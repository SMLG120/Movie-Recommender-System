Through a deal brokered by her loyal, longtime agent and the head of Miramount Studios, her alias will be controlled by the studio, and will star in any film they want with no restrictions. In return, she receives healthy compensation so she can care for her ailing son and her digitized character will stay forever young. Twenty years later, under the creative vision of the studio\u2019s head animator, Wright\u2019s digital double rises to immortal stardom. With her contract expiring, she is invited to take part in \u201cThe Congress\u201d convention as she makes her comeback straight into the world of future fantasy cinema.", "popularity": "8.534039", "poster_path": "/nnKX3ahYoT7P3au92dNgLf4pKwA.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Pandora Filmproduktion", "id": 254}, {"name": "Entre Chien et Loup", "id": 3984}, {"name": "Opus Film", "id": 6477}, {"name": "Bridgit Folman Film Gang", "id": 17931}, {"name": "Paul Thiltges Distributions", "id": 19437}, {"name": "Liverpool", "id": 60111}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "BE", "name": "Belgium"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IL", "name": "Israel"}, {"iso_3166_1": "LU", "name": "Luxembourg"}, {"iso_3166_1": "PL", "name": "Poland"}], "release_date": "2013-05-16", "revenue": "455815", "runtime": 122, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.4", "vote_count": "165"}
