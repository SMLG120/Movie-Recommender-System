The two contrarians laugh, confide and argue, in public and in private, as they journey through three cities. And the film captures it all. The result is a magnetic conflict, a character-driven narrative that sparkles cinematically with a perfect match of arresting personalities and intellectual rivalry. COLLISION is directed by prolific independent filmmaker Darren Doane (Van Morrison: Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl, The Battle For L.A., Godmoney).", "popularity": "0.557964", "poster_path": "/unP1LnMctWbJpU4gccMUefmErbd.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Crux Pictures", "id": 4738}], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2009-10-27", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 87, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.0", "vote_count": "3"}
