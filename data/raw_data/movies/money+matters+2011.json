Her relationship with her mother Pamela Matters (Aunjanue Ellis- RAY, MEN OF HONER), is far from stable and depicts the struggle between a young mother and daughter who both come of age...together. Sharp and candid dialogue blur the roles of parent and child, revealing a family secret magnified by pain and years of regret. Money's daily routine; a three-bus commute to the Catholic school she attends, far from her dilapidated neighborhood, to another world where she feels just as uncomfortable. When she befriends a neighborhood girl who seems to understand her, their friendship develops in ways that push boundaries.", "popularity": "0.148981", "poster_path": "/h1zol1IjrxHuNePhx7WqIb0fR5T.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2011-11-15", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 89, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "null", "vote_average": "6.5", "vote_count": "2"}
