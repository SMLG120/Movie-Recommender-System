This is the challenge Guillaume took up. The film recounts Guillaume's tragicomic battle from the young age of eight, as he adopts the role of a girl then of a homosexual... until, aged 30, he meets the woman who, after his mother, will become the other woman in his life. Beyond this story of a heterosexual coming-out, the film tells the tale of an actor who never stopped loving women, maybe even a little too much.", "popularity": "5.225386", "poster_path": "/A8qFJaPp9VuxyHaDBMchjFG3GqO.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Gaumont", "id": 9}, {"name": "LGM Productions", "id": 2490}, {"name": "Rectangle Productions", "id": 2700}, {"name": "Gaumont Distribution", "id": 13800}, {"name": "France 3 Cinema", "id": 16804}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "2013-11-20", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 85, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.6", "vote_count": "231"}
