Tarek is in high school, making Super 8 movies with his friend, Omar. At first the war is a lark: school has closed, the violence is fascinating, getting from West to East is a game. His mother wants to leave; his father refuses. Tarek spends time with May, a Christian, orphaned and living in his building. By accident, Tarek goes to an infamous brothel in the war-torn Olive Quarter, meeting its legendary madam, Oum Walid. He then takes Omar and May there using her underwear as a white flag for safe passage. Family tensions rise. As he comes of age, the war moves inexorably from adventure to tragedy.", "popularity": "0.219485", "poster_path": "/mevHjimIVDlQEPYlYnYNmUNYrdh.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Belge Francophone", "id": 792}, {"name": "Exposed Film Productions AS", "id": 5006}, {"name": "Norsk Rikskringkasting (NRK)", "id": 5404}, {"name": "Minist\u00e8re de la Culture de la Republique Fran\u00e7aise", "id": 11694}, {"name": "Centre National de la Cin\u00e9matographie (CNC)", "id": 18367}, {"name": "La Sept ARTE", "id": 19136}, {"name": "Douri Films", "id": 26890}, {"name": "Cin\u00e9 Libre", "id": 84496}, {"name": "ACCI", "id": 88165}, {"name": "38 Productions", "id": 88166}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "LB", "name": "Lebanon"}, {"iso_3166_1": "BE", "name": "Belgium"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "NO", "name": "Norway"}], "release_date": "1998-09-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 105, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ar", "name": "\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "8.8", "vote_count": "5"}
