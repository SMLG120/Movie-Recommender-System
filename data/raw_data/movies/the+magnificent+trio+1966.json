He sides with them after learning that this is an act of desperation to improve their low standard of living. The magistrate hires bandits and another fighter named Huang Liang (Cheng Lui) to get his daughter back. Huang recognizes Lu as a comrade in arms and joins him in fending off the bandits. The standoff comes to an abrupt end when the magistrate uses one of the farmer\u2019s daughters as leverage to get his own daughter back. Lu convinces the magistrate to punish him in place of the farmers, but he\u2019s lied to. The magistrate\u2019s daughter (Chin Ping) and a fighter in his employ (Lo Lieh), along with Huang help Lu to escape. Once recovered, our heroes return to see that a petition from the farmers gets to a higher-ranking official.", "popularity": "0.341629", "poster_path": "/5nzBKS5ZUrEl327OuC2HxXvl8Ox.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Shaw Brothers", "id": 5798}], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1966-11-08", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 103, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "zh", "name": "\u666e\u901a\u8bdd"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.8", "vote_count": "6"}
