Gordon Hempton is an Emmy Award-winning sound recordist who has spent the last 30 years trying to find and record the vanishing sounds of nature in an attempt to capture a disappearing sensory experience. Filmmaker Nick Sherman observes Hempton in the wilderness for 30 days and uncovers an obsessive artist on a quest for perfection in this obscure medium. Hempton\u2019s natural ability to locate and articulate himself through sound has a contagious energy and gives his work a transportive quality. Soundtracker is a fascinating meditation on the world\u2019s changing landscape and the things we may be leaving behind in the service of progress.", "popularity": "0.006284", "poster_path": "/3F23ryvSe2k0Ef4RNdkyZUqLjmG.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2010-05-02", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 88, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "0.0", "vote_count": "0"}
