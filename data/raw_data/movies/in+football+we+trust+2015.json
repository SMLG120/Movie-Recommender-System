Presenting a new take on the American immigrant story, this feature length documentary transports viewers deep inside the tightly-knit Polynesian community in Salt Lake City, Utah. With unprecedented access and shot over a four-year time period, the film intimately portrays four young Polynesian men striving to overcome gang violence and near poverty through American football. Viewed as the \"salvation\" for their families, these young players reveal the culture clash they experience as they transform out of their adolescence and into the high stakes world of collegiate recruiting and rigors of societal expectations.", "popularity": "0.079336", "poster_path": "/8Vw692QTM9qn9rjFPuIzQWApTyl.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2015-01-23", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 87, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.0", "vote_count": "1"}
