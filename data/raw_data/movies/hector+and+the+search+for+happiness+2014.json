As he tells his girlfriend, Clara, he feels like a fraud: he hasn\u2019t really tasted life, and yet he\u2019s offering advice to patients who are just not getting any happier. So Hector decides to break out of his deluded and routine driven life. Armed with buckets of courage and child-like curiosity, he embarks on a global quest in hopes of uncovering the elusive secret formula for true happiness. And so begins a larger than life adventure with riotously funny results.", "popularity": "12.330898", "poster_path": "/8EXGHKbT8EQRStYEYlNZUdCP414.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Wild Bunch", "id": 856}, {"name": "Erfttal Film", "id": 2221}, {"name": "Film Afrika Worldwide", "id": 4792}, {"name": "Head Gear Films", "id": 5056}, {"name": "Metrol Technology", "id": 25954}, {"name": "Egoli Tossell Film", "id": 44224}, {"name": "Construction Film", "id": 44225}, {"name": "Screen Siren Pictures", "id": 44226}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}, {"iso_3166_1": "ZA", "name": "South Africa"}, {"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}], "release_date": "2014-08-14", "revenue": "1124445", "runtime": 114, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.9", "vote_count": "317"}
