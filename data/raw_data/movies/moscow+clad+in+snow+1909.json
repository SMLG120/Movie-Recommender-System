First, the camera pans the Kremlin and Marshal's Bridge. Sleds are parked in rows. Horse-drawn sleighs run up and down a busy street. Next, we visit the mushroom and fish market where common people work and shop. In Petrovsky Park are the well-to-do. Men are in great coats. A file of six or seven women ski past on a narrow lane. Last, there's a general view of Moscow. A slow pan takes us to a view above the river front where the film began.", "popularity": "0.271515", "poster_path": "/8JH9vwuqsOMB71ejAiyRRbQlGuf.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Path\u00e9 Fr\u00e8res", "id": 21594}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1909-04-09", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 7, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "xx", "name": "No Language"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.5", "vote_count": "4"}
