Highsmith (Jackson) are the baddest and most beloved cops in New York City. They don't get tattoos, other men get tattoos of them. Two desks over and one back, sit detectives Allen Gamble (Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Wahlberg). You've seen them in the background of photos of Danson and Highsmith, out of focus and eyes closed. They're not heroes, they're \"the other guys.\" But every cop has his or her day and soon Gamble and Hoitz stumble into a seemingly innocuous case no other detective wants to touch that could turn into NYC's biggest crime. It's the opportunity of their lives, but do these guys have the right stuff?", "popularity": "12.536621", "poster_path": "/b4mYjC8kKx32BnCNBQeDCA76WBd.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Columbia Pictures", "id": 5}, {"name": "Gary Sanchez Productions", "id": 4740}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2010-08-06", "revenue": "170432927", "runtime": 107, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.1", "vote_count": "1406"}
