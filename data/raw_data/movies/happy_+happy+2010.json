She is an eternal optimist in spite of living with a man who would rather go hunting with the boys, and who refuses to have sex with her because she \"isn't particularly attractive\" anymore. Whatever. That's life. But when \"the perfect couple\" moves in next door, Kaja struggles to keep her emotions in check. Not only do these successful, beautiful, exciting people sing in a choir; they have also adopted a child \u2013 from Ethiopia!
