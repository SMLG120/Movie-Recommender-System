But, as usual, Lola is late. With her job and girlfriend on the line, she has three chances to make it right. In a desperate race through the streets and back rooms of San Francisco, time grows short-will Lola make it? Will she come at all? With a pop sensibility that mixes live action, animation and still photography, And Then Came Lola explores love's age old question in a fresh new way, \"If you try, try again, will you finally get it right?\" (Written by M. Siler and E. Seidler)", "popularity": "1.319694", "poster_path": "/9wOq17Wp9L5NLLRmsjR2qlvdBbm.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2009-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 71, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.0", "vote_count": "14"}
