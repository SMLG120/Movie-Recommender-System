Frank Baum's classic, the \"Tin Man\" follows the adventures of DG, a waitress and part-time student, as she travels through the mystical world of \"The O. Z. (Outer Zone)\", discovering her hidden past. This well-known story takes a twist in this SyFy adaptation as DG battles the sorceress Azkadellia along with the help of four friends; Glitch, a former adviser to the Queen whose brain has been removed; Raw, a psychic empath; and Wyatt Cain, a former police man (aka Tin-man) who has been imprisoned in an iron suit, forced to watch his family's destruction time and time again. Although parallels can be made to the original book this story takes its own path down the yellow brick road.", "popularity": "6.362129", "poster_path": "/jXv8oy3LmljWe8pzYn0VAc4LJ6N.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "RHI", "id": 6739}], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2007-04-17", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 270, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.6", "vote_count": "57"}
