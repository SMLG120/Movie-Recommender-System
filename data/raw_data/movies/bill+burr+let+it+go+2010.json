The name itself is synonymous with legendary performances. Countless iconic musicians and comedians have been on that stage. To be a part of that history was something I\u2019ll never forget. As much as I was trying to keep my head together before the show, I couldn\u2019t help but feel like a tourist or just some random dude who won a contest. LET IT GO represents the culmination of material I developed on the road from 2008-2009. As always thanks to everyone who came out to my shows, laughed at the funny stuff and stared during the bombing. I hope you enjoy it. \u2013 Bill Burr", "popularity": "1.296848", "poster_path": "/8ojrpI8QKpcedkp9OBYA418k4Fh.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2010-09-18", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 65, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "8.0", "vote_count": "21"}
