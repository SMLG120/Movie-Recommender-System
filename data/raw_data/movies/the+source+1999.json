Burroughs in 1997. Three actors provide dramatic interpretations of the work of these three writers, and the film chronicles their friendships, their arrival into American consciousness, their travels, frequent parodies, Kerouac's death, and Ginsberg's politicization. Their movement connects with bebop, John Cage's music, abstract expressionism, and living theater. In recent interviews, Ginsberg, Burroughs, Kesey, Ferlinghetti, Mailer, Jerry Garcia, Tom Hayden, Gary Snyder, Ed Sanders, and others measure the Beats' meaning and impact.", "popularity": "0.447313", "poster_path": "/3C6B4u9QIQqmvtw3YHTcx2ubsXj.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1999-01-01", "revenue": "360895", "runtime": 88, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "4.9", "vote_count": "5"}
