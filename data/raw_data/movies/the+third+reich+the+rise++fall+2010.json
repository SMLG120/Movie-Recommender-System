Immersive and evocative, it takes viewers inside the Germany of the 20s, 30s, and early 40s, through the use of rare and never-before-seen home movies, Nazi propaganda films and other contemporaneous material. The narrative consists of personal recollections culled from German's diaries, journals and letters. The end result is an intimate, richly nuanced and authentic portrait of the Third Reich and its people.", "popularity": "0.376485", "poster_path": "/53hWAHq4thQVB65YyEJMf14t2MV.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2010-12-14", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 180, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "9.0", "vote_count": "4"}
