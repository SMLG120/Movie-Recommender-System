Newbie roadie Tom (lead singer Matt Berninger\u2019s younger brother) is a heavy metal and horror movie enthusiast, and can't help but put his own spin on the experience. Inevitably, Tom\u2019s moonlighting as an irreverent documentarian creates some drama for the band on the road. The film is a hilarious and touching look at two very different brothers, and an entertaining story of artistic aspiration.", "popularity": "0.063568", "poster_path": "/aaclaq77XIBEGF3D7iEwsbjXGOR.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Final Frame", "id": 82020}, {"name": "C5", "id": 82021}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2013-09-19", "revenue": "137460", "runtime": 75, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.2", "vote_count": "21"}
