Adapted from John Irving's best-selling novel A Widow for One Year, the film is set in the privileged beach community of East Hampton, New York and chronicles one pivotal summer in the lives of famous children's book author Ted Cole (Jeff Bridges) and his beautiful wife Marion (Kim Basinger). Their once-great marriage has been strained by tragedy. Her resulting despondency and his subsequent infidelities have prevented the couple from confronting a much-needed change in their relationship. Eddie O'Hare, the young man Ted hires to work as his summer assistant, is the couple's unwitting yet willing pawn - and, ultimately, the catalyst in the transformation of their lives.", "popularity": "3.495966", "poster_path": "/snmS5sgdoVVXY8YJMbrdPAEPuIM.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Revere Pictures", "id": 1043}, {"name": "Focus Features", "id": 10146}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2004-07-18", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 111, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.0", "vote_count": "48"}
