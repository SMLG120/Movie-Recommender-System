Dana Andrews stars as a drifter named Eric Stanton, who, after landing in a small California town, falls in love with Stella (Linda Darnell), a diner waitress. She makes it clear that she'll have nothing to do with Eric unless he has some money, so he hatches a plan to marry June Mills (Alice Faye), a wealthy reclusive spinster who is in love with him. Unfortunately, right after the wedding, Stella turns up dead, and the blame is placed on Eric.", "popularity": "3.242793", "poster_path": "/eGtRuKRXfhf6dX1VWhI6e1I0uQU.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation", "id": 306}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1945-11-07", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 98, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.8", "vote_count": "23"}
