The incendiary anti-Modernist Munnings, now regarded as one of Britain's most sought-after artists, is at the centre of the complex love triangle, involving aspiring artist Florence Carter-Wood and Gilbert Evans, the land agent in charge of the Lamorna Valley estate. True - and deeply moving - the story is played out against the timeless beauty of the Cornish coast, in the approaching shadow of The Great War.", "popularity": "10.47983", "poster_path": "/f0DEGfhf6z3tBfO3vwBcPKrnD2w.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Marwood Pictures", "id": 32200}, {"name": "CrossDay Productions Ltd.", "id": 32201}, {"name": "Apart Films", "id": 32202}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2013-06-13", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 101, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "hu", "name": "Magyar"}, {"iso_639_1": "pt", "name": "Portugu\u00eas"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.6", "vote_count": "37"}
