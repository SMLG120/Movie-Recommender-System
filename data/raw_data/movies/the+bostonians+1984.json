This bittersweet tragicomedy centers on an odd triangle of characters: Basil Ransom, a political conservative from Mississippi; Olive Chancellor, Ransom's cousin and a Boston feminist; and Verena Tarrant, a pretty, young prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Olive's in the feminist movement. The storyline concerns the struggle between Ransom and Olive for Verena's allegiance and affection, though the film also includes a wide panorama of political activists, newspaper people, and quirky eccentrics.", "popularity": "0.182355", "poster_path": "/4uazNAqRKGGUBPNM8yciziWcThn.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Merchant Ivory Productions", "id": 2370}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "1984-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 122, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.5", "vote_count": "4"}
