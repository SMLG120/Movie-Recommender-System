Batya, a catering waitress, takes in a young child apparently abandoned at a local beach. Batya is one of the servers at the wedding reception of Keren, a young bride who breaks her leg in trying to escape from a locked toilet stall, which ruins her chance at a romantic honeymoon in the Caribbean. One of the guests is Joy, a Philippine chore woman attending the event with her employer, and who doesn't speak any Hebrew (she communicates mainly in English), and who is guilt-ridden after having left her young son behind in the Philippines.", "popularity": "0.750591", "poster_path": "/3YVy3jz3OxI8kyAOa2pj8p34F3x.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Les Films du Poisson", "id": 2426}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IL", "name": "Israel"}], "release_date": "2007-05-05", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 82, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "he", "name": "\u05e2\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.4", "vote_count": "10"}
