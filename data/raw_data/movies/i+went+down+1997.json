He's now in trouble with the mob boss, Tom French, who sends Git to Cork with another debtor, Bunny Kelly, to find a guy named Frank Grogan, and take him to a man with a friendly face at a shack across a bog. It's a tougher assignment than it seems: Git's a novice, Bunny's prone to rash acts, Frank doesn't want to be found (and once he's found, he has no money), and maybe Tom's planning to murder Frank, which puts Git in a moral dilemma. Then, there's the long-ago disappearance of Sonny Mulligan. What's a decent and stand-up lad to do?", "popularity": "0.559621", "poster_path": "/na3413fBGD0Hyiy5FOvcWYWbJ7x.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Shooting Gallery", "id": 1596}, {"name": "B\u00f3rd Scann\u00e1n na h\u00c9ireann", "id": 1898}, {"name": "British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)", "id": 3324}, {"name": "Treasure Entertainment", "id": 21872}, {"name": "Radio Telef\u00eds \u00c9ireann (RT\u00c9)", "id": 40605}, {"name": "Easkel Media", "id": 70198}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IE", "name": "Ireland"}], "release_date": "1997-10-03", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 97, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.5", "vote_count": "2"}
