Rosselini's 'Chastity' ('Illibatezza') deals with an attractive air hostess who receives the unwelcome attentions of a middle aged American. Godard's 'New World' ('Il Nuovo Mondo') illustrates a post-apocalypse world the same as the pre-apocalyptic one but for an enigmatic change in attitude in most people, including the central character's girlfriend. In Pasolini's 'Curd Cheese' ('La Ricotta'), a lavish film about the life of Jesus Christ is being made in a poor area. The impoverished people subject themselves to various indignities in the name of moviemaking in order to win a little food. The central character is hoisted up on a cross for filming, and dies there. Finally comes Gregoretti's 'Free Range Chicken' ('Il Pollo Ruspante') in which a family of the materialist culture inadvertantly illustrate the cynical, metallic voiced doctrine of a top sales theorist.", "popularity": "0.382572", "poster_path": "/6SMfpb6jpGXnr1EuqC6VPMRjIAo.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Arco Film", "id": 4498}, {"name": "Cineriz", "id": 9387}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1963-02-19", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 122, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "it", "name": "Italiano"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.4", "vote_count": "7"}
