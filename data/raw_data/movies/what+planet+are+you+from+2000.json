The alien, Harold Anderson, goes to Phoenix as a banker and sets to work finding a mate. His approaches to women are inept, and the humming phallus doesn't help, but on the advice of a banking colleague, he cruises an AA meeting, meets Susan, and somehow convinces her to marry. The clock starts to tick: will she conceive, have a baby, and lose Harold (and the child) to his planet before he discovers emotion and starts to care?", "popularity": "1.994868", "poster_path": "/h4y0j7DO6qRzaFocG1N0710yXaQ.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Columbia Pictures", "id": 5}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2000-03-03", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 105, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.4", "vote_count": "37"}
