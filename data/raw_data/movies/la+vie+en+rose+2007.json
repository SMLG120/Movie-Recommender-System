From the mean streets of the Belleville district of Paris to the dazzling limelight of New York's most famous concert halls, Piaf's life was a constant battle to sing and survive, to live and love. Raised in her grandmother's brothel, Piaf was discovered in 1935 by nightclub owner Louis Leplee (Gerard Depardieu), who persuaded her to sing despite her extreme nervousness. Piaf became one of France's immortal icons, her voice one of the indelible signatures of the 20th Century.", "popularity": "11.710507", "poster_path": "/xJMbQkNKt85ZSIh4HucDwENL8dq.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "TF1 Films Production", "id": 3823}, {"name": "Canal+", "id": 5358}, {"name": "TPS Star", "id": 6586}, {"name": "TF1 International", "id": 7799}, {"name": "Sofica Valor 7", "id": 11942}, {"name": "L\u00e9gende Films", "id": 22997}, {"name": "Okko Productions", "id": 31660}, {"name": "Songbird Pictures", "id": 84482}, {"name": "Scotts Atlantic", "id": 84483}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CZ", "name": "Czech Republic"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2007-02-08", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 140, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.3", "vote_count": "433"}
