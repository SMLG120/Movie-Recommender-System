When they meet and fall in love with two young American girls, Lillian and Connie, who are vacationing in France, Ram and Eddie must decide whether they should move back to America with them, or stay in Paris for the freedom it allows them. Ram, who wants to be a serious composer, finds Paris more exciting than America and is reluctant to give up his music for a relationship, and Eddie wants to stay for the city's more tolerant racial atmosphere.", "popularity": "2.073112", "poster_path": "/wmC1KwC9wlMQhfMy678UdQ2duVL.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Pennebaker Productions", "id": 10568}, {"name": "Monmouth", "id": 32994}, {"name": "Diane Productions", "id": 32995}, {"name": "Jason Films", "id": 32996}, {"name": "Monica Corp.", "id": 32997}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1961-09-27", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 98, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.1", "vote_count": "10"}
