During one of their \"jobs\" they end up with a young German hostage whose father escapes to return news of the kidnapping and robbery to the King. Kozlik prepares for the wrath of the King, and sends Mikol\u00e1s to pressure his neighbor Lazar to join him in war. Persuasion fails, and in vengeance Mikol\u00e1s abducts Lazar's daughter Marketa, just as she was about to join a convent. The King, meantime, dispatches an army and the religious Lazar will be called upon to join hands against Kozlik. Stripped-down, surreal, and relentlessly grimy account of the shift from Paganism to Christianity.", "popularity": "2.484463", "poster_path": "/4vGcn1FlsaXdPuFZ3Rhdtkg65Ay.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Filmov\u00e9 studio Barrandov", "id": 66848}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "CZ", "name": "Czech Republic"}], "release_date": "1967-11-24", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 162, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "cs", "name": "\u010cesk\u00fd"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "8.0", "vote_count": "32"}
