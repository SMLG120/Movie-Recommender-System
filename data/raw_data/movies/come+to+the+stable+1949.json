It is a simple, reverent story of French nuns and their powerful faith as they push New Englanders toward funding a new hospital. Old-fashioned and tedious by the standards of today, it ought to be remembered if only for it's Oscar nominations (none of which earned a an Oscar).", "popularity": "0.107344", "poster_path": "/6clUGTNoDaKNR2a3QNGXVWaoE5O.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation", "id": 306}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1949-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 94, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.0", "vote_count": "1"}
