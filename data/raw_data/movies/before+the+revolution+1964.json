Fabrizio is passionate, idealistic, influenced by Cesare, a teacher and Marxist, engaged to the lovely but bourgeois Clelia, and stung by the drowning of his mercurial friend Agostino, a possible suicide. Gina is herself a bundle of nervous energy, alternately sweet, seductive, poetic, distracted, and unhinged. They begin a love affair after Agostino's funeral, then Gina confuses Fabrizio by sleeping with a stranger. Their visits to Cesare and then to Puck, one of Gina's older friends, a landowner losing his land, dramatize contrasting images of Italy's future. Their own futures are bleak.", "popularity": "1.316212", "poster_path": "/4XzyPQbj79U1SUuqOXthZwZBhnw.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Cineriz", "id": 9387}, {"name": "Iride Cinematografica", "id": 54425}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}], "release_date": "1964-05-13", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 115, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "it", "name": "Italiano"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.1", "vote_count": "13"}
