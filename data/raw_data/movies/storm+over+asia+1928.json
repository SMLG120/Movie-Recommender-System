Ostracized from the trading post, he escapes to the hills after brawling with the trader who cheated him. In 1920 he becomes a Soviet partisan, and helps the partisans fight for the Soviets against the occupying British army. However he is captured by the British when they try to requisition cattle from the herdsmen at the same time as the commandant meets with a reincarnated Grand Lama. After the trapper is shot, the army discovers an amulet that suggests he is a direct descendant of Genghis Khan. They find him still alive, so the army restores his health and plans to use him as the head of a puppet regime. The trapper is thus thrust into prominence as he is placed in charge of the puppet government. By the end, however, the \"puppet\" turns against his masters in an outburst of fury.", "popularity": "1.680835", "poster_path": "/gNy44LCxPeoIB8Bj7YLaNWDjGTw.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Mezhrabpomfilm", "id": 8970}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "RU", "name": "Russia"}], "release_date": "1928-11-10", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 127, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "xx", "name": "No Language"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.9", "vote_count": "13"}
