A coming-of-age tale of three teenagers and their passionate love for a sport on the crumbling tarmac of the streets in the German Democratic Republic, which was considered very ill-fitting. The punk fairy tale is a story of the subversive powers of fun in that part of Germany, which had lost touch with its citizens. The film follows its three heroes from their childhood in the seventies through their teenage rebellion in the eighties, ending in the last summer of their life in the German Democratic Republic in 1989, when their life changed forever, and follows them to 2011.", "popularity": "0.76798", "poster_path": "/ri1KFV7AxAgtFDCPynHvBr8kl2T.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2012-08-15", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.5", "vote_count": "14"}
