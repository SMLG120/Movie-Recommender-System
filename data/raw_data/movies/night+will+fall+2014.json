Making use of British, Soviet and American footage, the Ministry of Information\u2019s Sidney Bernstein (later founder of Granada Television) aimed to create a documentary that would provide lasting, undeniable evidence of the Nazis\u2019 unspeakable crimes. He commissioned a wealth of British talent, including editor Stewart McAllister, writer and future cabinet minister Richard Crossman \u2013 and, as treatment advisor, his friend Alfred Hitchcock. Yet, despite initial support from the British and US Governments, the film was shelved, and only now, 70 years on, has it been restored and completed by Imperial War Museums under its original title \"German Concentration Camps Factual Survey\".", "popularity": "1.742732", "poster_path": "/2RMyh4qOQJEZKaPaywoWn4pnbCg.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Spring Films", "id": 9158}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2014-06-07", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 75, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.8", "vote_count": "22"}
