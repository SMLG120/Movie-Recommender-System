He's never late for work and nothing interesting ever happens to him. One day everything changes: he oversleeps and is fired as an example, he's then mistaken for evil criminal killer Mannion and is arrested.

The real Mannion sees the opportunity to steal the pass and move around freely and chaos results.", "popularity": "0.887774", "poster_path": "/mUq4dLr9DS7qmccLNwwKe4DJgJt.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Columbia Pictures Corporation", "id": 441}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1935-02-22", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 93, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.7", "vote_count": "7"}
