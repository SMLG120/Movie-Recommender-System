With this unprecedented access, Emmy-winning, Oscar-nominated filmmaker Robert B. Weide followed the notoriously private film legend over a year and a half to create the ultimate film biography. \"Woody Allen: A Documentary\" chronicles Allen's career - from teen writer to Sid Caesar's TV scribe, from stand-up comedian to award-winning writer-director averaging one film-per-year for more than 40 years. Exploring Allen's writing habits, casting, directing, and relationship with his actors first-hand, new interviews with A-listers, writing partners, family and friends provide insight and backstory to the usually inscrutable filmmaker.", "popularity": "2.945649", "poster_path": "/g9gKlmlQuOxOmlf4rA89WsY7wCc.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Insurgent Media", "id": 7407}, {"name": "Rat Entertainment", "id": 12007}, {"name": "Mike's Movies", "id": 12323}, {"name": "Whyaduck Productions", "id": 62702}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2011-11-20", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 192, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.5", "vote_count": "56"}
