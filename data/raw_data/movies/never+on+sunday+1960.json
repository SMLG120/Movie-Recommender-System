Ilya is a character close to the \"hooker with a heart of gold\" clich\u00e9. Homer feels Ilya's life style typifies the degradation of Greek classical culture and attempts to steer her onto the path of morality. It constitutes a variation of the Pygmalion story.  The film stars Melina Mercouri and Jules Dassin, and it gently submerges the viewer into Greek culture, including dance, music, and language (through the use of subtitles). The signature song and the bouzouki theme of the movie became hits of the 1960s and brought the composer, Manos Hadjidakis, an Academy Award.", "popularity": "1.879162", "poster_path": "/iHXtTX8l9tfIqL7NsZ76Nfmj72r.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "MelinaFilm", "id": 8526}, {"name": "Lopert Pictures Corporation", "id": 39125}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GR", "name": "Greece"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1960-05-24", "revenue": "8000000", "runtime": 91, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "el", "name": "\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac"}, {"iso_639_1": "ru", "name": "P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.0", "vote_count": "14"}
