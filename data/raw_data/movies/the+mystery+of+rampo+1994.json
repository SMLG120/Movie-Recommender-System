However, after burning his drafts, his publisher shows him a newspaper with an account of events just like his forbidden story. As the film progresses, fantasy and reality intermingle in a tale that draws heavily on influences from Poe and Stoker's Dracula. The film's strongly Expressionistic direction skillfully combines a variety of media (animation, computer-generated imagery, grainy black-and-white fast film stock, color negatives) for artistic effect.", "popularity": "0.577259", "poster_path": "/wJwpYxyUwV2EuysXQRZlgUCVanB.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "JP", "name": "Japan"}], "release_date": "1994-06-25", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 100, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.0", "vote_count": "1"}
