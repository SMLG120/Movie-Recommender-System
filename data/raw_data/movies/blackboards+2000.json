Said falls in with a group of old men looking for their bombed-out village; he offers to guide them, and takes as his wife Halaleh, the clan's lone woman, a widow with a young son. Reeboir attaches himself to a dozen pre-teen boys weighed down by contraband they carry across the border; they're mules, always on the move. Said and Reeboir try to teach as their potential students keep walking. Danger is close; armed soldiers patrol the skies, the roads, and the border. Is there a role for a teacher? Is there hope?", "popularity": "0.770711", "poster_path": "/9vbkcxNoovqWQ0oxjePZhhtIaeH.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Rai Cinemafiction", "id": 238}, {"name": "Fabrica", "id": 54378}, {"name": "Makhmalbaf Productions", "id": 54379}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IR", "name": "Iran"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}, {"iso_3166_1": "JP", "name": "Japan"}], "release_date": "2000-09-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 85, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ku", "name": ""}, {"iso_639_1": "fa", "name": "\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.2", "vote_count": "12"}
