After serving 35 years, it is no surprise that the world has changed dramatically.

He then heads for Istanbul to get revenge upon his former best friend, the man who snitched on him and stole his lover Keje. Along the way, Baran teams up with Cumali, a tough young punk who finds the thief's old-fashioned ways rather quaint. When Cumali gets into deep trouble with a crime boss, Baran adds another vengeful task to his roster.", "popularity": "1.961587", "poster_path": "/z8LKvkaPJ62qPDEGtIMYfk9RVge.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Filma-Cass", "id": 47853}, {"name": "ArtCam", "id": 75290}, {"name": "Geopoly", "id": 75291}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "TR", "name": "Turkey"}], "release_date": "1996-11-29", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 121, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "tr", "name": "T\u00fcrk\u00e7e"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.5", "vote_count": "51"}
