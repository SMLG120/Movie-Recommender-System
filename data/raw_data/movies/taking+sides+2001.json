One of the most spectacular and renowned conductors of the 30s, Furtwangler's reputation rivaled that of Toscanini's. After the war, he was investigated as part of the Allies' de-Nazification programme. In the bombed-out Berlin of the immediate post-war period, the Allies slowly bring law and order--and justice--to bear on an occupied Germany. An American major is given the Furtwangler file, and is told to find everything he can and to prosecute the man ruthlessly. Tough and hard-nosed, Major Steve Arnold sets out to investigate a world of which he knows nothing. Orchestra members vouch for Furtwangler's morality--he did what he could to protect Jewish players from his orchestra. To the Germans, deeply respectful of their musical heritage, Furtwangler was a demigod; to Major Arnold, he is just a lying, weak-willed Nazi.", "popularity": "5.760896", "poster_path": "/3YtVOY74c6uiZYFS2ydnS7oEPEr.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "AT", "name": "Austria"}, {"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2001-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 108, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "ru", "name": "P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.1", "vote_count": "12"}
