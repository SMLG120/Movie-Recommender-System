It takes place some forty years after the end of the previous film. In the earlier film, a young man has moved with his family to Marseilles from Armenia and is adapting to his new country to the best of his ability. This tends to put him in conflict with his traditional Armenian family. Nonetheless, they are all hardworking and loving. Now, forty years later, the lead character has changed his name to Pierre Zakar, because it is easier for the French to pronounce and relate to. He has also become a very successful playwright.", "popularity": "0.838046", "poster_path": "/ajfnXOPAi2VHl3X4jtquQaen9k2.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "AMLF", "id": 1869}, {"name": "TF1 Films Production", "id": 3823}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1992-01-14", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 135, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.1", "vote_count": "4"}
