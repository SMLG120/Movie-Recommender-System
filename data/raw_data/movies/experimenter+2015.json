Stanley Milgram designs a psychology experiment that still resonates to this day, in which people think they\u2019re delivering painful electric shocks to an affable stranger strapped into a chair in another room. Despite his pleads for mercy, the majority of subjects don\u2019t stop the experiment, administering what they think is a near-fatal electric shock, simply because they\u2019ve been told to do so. With Nazi Adolf Eichmann\u2019s trial airing in living rooms across America, Milgram strikes a nerve in popular culture and the scientific community with his exploration into people\u2019s tendency to comply with authority. Celebrated in some circles, he is also accused of being a deceptive, manipulative monster, but his wife Sasha stands by him through it all.", "popularity": "5.112935", "poster_path": "/gyFMUvk7gDMYQa988CaYz65COks.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "FJ Productions", "id": 17090}, {"name": "BB Film Productions", "id": 41602}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2015-10-16", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 97, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.8", "vote_count": "166"}
