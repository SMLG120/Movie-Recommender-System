Beginning with the band's first concert performances in the mid-'70s, Gramaglia explores the eccentric and highly volatile band members -- in all the various line-ups that were presented over the years -- as the Ramones slowly gained fame for their high energy and high-tempo style of music that would later influence generations of punk rockers around the world. Mixing archival interviews with new interviews of the various surviving bandmembers, as well as interviews with a number of the Ramones' contemporaries, End of the Century encapsulates the East Coast underground music atmosphere of the 1970s and '80s that the band inadvertently shocked into existence.", "popularity": "1.016632", "poster_path": "/pZZR3oDnIUZff6puM9ctolafJpg.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Magnolia Pictures", "id": 1030}, {"name": "Gugat Films", "id": 69843}, {"name": "Chinagraph", "id": 69844}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2003-01-19", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 110, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.9", "vote_count": "12"}
