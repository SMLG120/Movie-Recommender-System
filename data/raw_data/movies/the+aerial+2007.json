The film features Alejandro Urdapilleta, Rafael Ferro, Florencia Raggi, and others. The movie begins with a pair of hands typing on a typewriter. The denizens of a nameless city \"in the year XX\" have lost their voices. People communicate by mouthing out words that are spelled mid-air. The only person who has kept the use of her voice is La Voz (\"the voice\"), a singer working for the sole TV channel broadcast in the city, run by Mr. TV, who desires La Voz. La Voz wears a hood over her head that hides away her face. She has a son called Tom\u00e1s, an eyeless little kid who nonetheless also has a voice (although this is kept a secret). Tom\u00e1s lives next door to Ana, whom he one day befriends after a letter addressed to his house is erroneously delivered to hers.", "popularity": "1.59064", "poster_path": "/755YOP1AunhprrhyBIGJLnB6kbh.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "LadobleA", "id": 3836}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "AR", "name": "Argentina"}], "release_date": "2007-04-17", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 99, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.1", "vote_count": "19"}
