The administration is concerned mainly with forms and rules (there's an up and and a down staircase); bells ring at the wrong time. Nevertheless, she tries. How she handles the chaos and her despair in her first semester makes up the film: a promising student drops out, another sleeps through class, a girl with a crush on a male teacher gets suicidal, and a bright but troublesome student misunderstands Sylvia's reaching out. A discussion of Dickens, parents' night, and a mock trial highlight the term. Can she make it?", "popularity": "0.604325", "poster_path": "/bSPKwS3JaGaNL6EAuLVb46y32Im.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Park Place Production", "id": 27756}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1967-01-19", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 124, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.2", "vote_count": "5"}
