Carlson, and first published by Zondervan. The book was adapted in 1979 into a movie. The Late, Great Planet Earth is a treatment of literalist, premillennial, dispensational eschatology. As such, it compared end-time prophecies in the Bible with then-current events in an attempt to broadly predict future scenarios leading to the rapture of believers before the tribulation and Second Coming of Christ to establish his thousand-year (i.e. millennial) Kingdom on Earth.", "popularity": "0.006091", "poster_path": "/xqHt4IQcH3caAiKbcImyCldu6gk.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1979-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 91, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "1.0", "vote_count": "1"}
