She gets to know her latex and wooden travelling partners along the way, and with them deconstructs herself and her lost love in this ventriloquial docu-mocumentary requiem. Ken Campbell was a hugely respected maverick of the British Theatre, an eccentric genius who would snort out forgotten artforms. Nina was his prodigy in ventriloquism and has been said to have reinvented the artform. This film is truly unique in genre and style. No one has seen ventriloquism like this before.", "popularity": "0.271013", "poster_path": "/4FrcWv1yqZQ96LwLvbPzmb3YNJh.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)", "id": 3324}, {"name": "Nina Conti Production", "id": 21620}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2012-03-11", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 64, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "8.1", "vote_count": "4"}
