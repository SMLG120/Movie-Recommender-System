It is a concept both intimate and vast - the perfect subject for filmmakers Ron Fricke and Mark Magidson, whose previous collaborations include Chronos and Baraka, and who, in the last 20 years, have travelled to over 58 countries together in the pursuit of unique imagery.  Samsara takes the form of a nonverbal, guided meditation that will transform viewers in countries around the world as they are swept along a journey of the soul. Through powerful images pristinely photographed in 70mm and a dynamic music score, the film illuminates the links between humanity and the rest of the nature, showing how our life cycle mirrors the rhythm of the planet.", "popularity": "9.491177", "poster_path": "/48DZ4MewllwsQ3tOsky5GhOcuBT.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Magidson Films", "id": 10986}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2011-09-16", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 102, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "8.0", "vote_count": "169"}
