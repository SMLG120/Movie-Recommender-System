His son's death has developed antagonism by MacKenzie toward all Dutchmen, which leads to Harry brawling at school with the son of a Dutchman. Harry falls down a cliff and is helped home by the community doctor, Willem Bloem, a Dutchman in love with MacKenzie's daughter, Kirsty. Due to the old man's feelings, they must carry on a clandestine romance. Forbidden by their grandfather to have a dog, Harry and Davy \"kidnap\" an unattended baby and care for the child in a lean-to shack. When found, the baby proves to be the child of MacKenzie's most-bitter Dutch enemy.", "popularity": "0.502356", "poster_path": "/uoiQhuY4qXjmbK3WToc9UvDzMeu.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Group Film Productions", "id": 10584}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "1953-12-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 93, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.0", "vote_count": "3"}
