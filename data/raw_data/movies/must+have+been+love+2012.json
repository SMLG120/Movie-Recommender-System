Shot in Oslo, Helsinki, Istanbul and Berlin. The film focuses on showing the actual moments that lead to getting to know one another, building a relationship and to breaking up. The film takes part in Kaisa\u2019s attempt of getting involved with two different men that look almost exactly the same, questioning where the thin line is between someone potentially being the love of your life or not. Shooting the film with the approach of a workshop and closely involving the actors allows the film to take shape as a unique, unpredictable cinematic expression touching the basis and complexity of human behavior.", "popularity": "0.420708", "poster_path": "/4AXYrfdhoUT3VDZg3vPTSU7wn3P.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "4 1/2", "id": 7843}], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2012-10-18", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "no", "name": "Norsk"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "fi", "name": "suomi"}, {"iso_639_1": "tr", "name": "T\u00fcrk\u00e7e"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.5", "vote_count": "2"}
