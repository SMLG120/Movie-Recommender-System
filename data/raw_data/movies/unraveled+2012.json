Brazen forgeries and impersonations branded the white collar crime spree remarkable. \"Unraveled\" is set in the purgatory of house arrest -- an Upper East Side penthouse -- where the Court has ordered Dreier confined until his sentencing day. The film weaves Dreier's struggle to prepare for the possibility of life imprisonment with first-person flashbacks, which reveal his audacious path of destruction. Destroyed by his own hubris, Dreier attempts to grasp his tragic unraveling. With unprecedented access, \"Unraveled\" exposes a mastermind of criminal deception.", "popularity": "0.212166", "poster_path": "/Adm3NLGZBP4AnyiWo1KsCHWiZrR.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2012-04-13", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 85, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.3", "vote_count": "4"}
