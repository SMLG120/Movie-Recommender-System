The third directorial effort of Jari Halonen, a clearly distinctive voice in the local filmmaking landscape, is a timeless, absurd and at times completely insane piece of masculine comedy rough not only on the edges, but to the core. A story of Mike, just out of prison, and his buddies throwing a Christmas party under the most obscure circumstances is filled with juicy dialogue and plot twists that will definitely make your jaw drop \u2013 and have you chuckle for days after.", "popularity": "0.235641", "poster_path": "/qYDjX8hxakntm5TnarttUlLnzol.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Sepp\u00e4 Callahanin Filmimaailma Oy", "id": 17889}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FI", "name": "Finland"}], "release_date": "1996-11-29", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 84, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fi", "name": "suomi"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.0", "vote_count": "1"}
