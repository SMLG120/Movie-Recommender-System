The film with comic undertones looks at their stories behind the hedges.  The garden provides a framework for tales of relationship conflicts and joys; it depicts the many ways in which life can flourish; it gives strength and unites, but it also becomes a meeting place for farewells. There is an invisible bond that grows between the couples in the film; they comment and comfort each other with their own stories.", "popularity": "0.093541", "poster_path": "/6pKNGM01lV350PNy382ThRG8813.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Made Oy", "id": 86915}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FI", "name": "Finland"}], "release_date": "2014-03-07", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 73, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fi", "name": "suomi"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "0.0", "vote_count": "0"}
