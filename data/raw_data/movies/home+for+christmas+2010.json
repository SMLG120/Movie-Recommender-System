The plot unfolds during a few afternoon hours on Christmas Eve. The individual stories, which at times intertwine, are set in the small town Skogli. The characters in the stories cover a great range in age and life situations, representing both reconciliation with their own lives and strong frustration. Some show the will to understand and do something about their lives, while others have given up. Deeply tragic and melancholy aspects are mixed with humour and rather frivolous solutions.", "popularity": "0.472903", "poster_path": "/xNWuXu6zDIwAfRcW48rybE1tAr5.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Pandora Filmproduktion", "id": 254}, {"name": "Bulbul Films", "id": 4227}, {"name": "Filmimperiet Sverige", "id": 94932}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "NO", "name": "Norway"}, {"iso_3166_1": "SE", "name": "Sweden"}], "release_date": "2010-11-12", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "no", "name": "Norsk"}, {"iso_639_1": "sr", "name": "Srpski"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.0", "vote_count": "2"}
