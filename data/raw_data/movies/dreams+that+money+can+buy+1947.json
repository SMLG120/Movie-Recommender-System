The plot is than an average Joe (Jack Bittner) can conjure up dreams that will improve peoples lives. This gives an excuse to view sequences created by several artists, most of whom were living in the US to avoid World War II.  Collaborators included Max Ernst, Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray, Alexander Calder, Darius Milhaud and Fernand L\u00e9ger. The film won the Award for the Best Original Contribution to the Progress of Cinematography at the 1947 Venice Film Festival. Besides Bu\u00f1uel's work this is considered to be the last official surrealist film.", "popularity": "0.244574", "poster_path": "/ppbvd6CPIlqNOKeD3ujOqLZLNd5.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1947-09-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 99, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.2", "vote_count": "6"}
