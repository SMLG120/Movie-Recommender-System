When Hyakkimaru kills a demon, he wins back a body part. He is spotted in one of these battles, with a giant spider demon, by Dororo, a scrappy female thief who is fascinated by not only Hyakkimaru's prowess with the sword blade poking out of his arm but the new leg he grows after dicing his opponent. Is he a man -- or a monster? After hearing his story from an old minstrel, she decides to join him on his travels and find out for herself.", "popularity": "1.487834", "poster_path": "/ty1s9j37BeIDkFKrpKBGy52Z24o.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Toho Company", "id": 882}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "JP", "name": "Japan"}], "release_date": "2007-03-15", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 139, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.4", "vote_count": "17"}
