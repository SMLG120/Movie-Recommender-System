Most are brown or sepia; up close, we can see patterns within wings, similar to the veins in a leaf. Sometimes the images look like paper cutouts, like Matisse. Green objects occasionally appear. Most wings are translucent. The technique makes them appear to be stuck directly to the film.", "popularity": "1.440641", "poster_path": "/46v96wL46Qlcp5hr8dsdvPd235Z.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1963-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 4, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "xx", "name": "No Language"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.1", "vote_count": "23"}
