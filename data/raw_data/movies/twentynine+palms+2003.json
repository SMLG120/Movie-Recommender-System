They find a motel in the town of Twentynine Palms and spend their days in their sport-utility vehicle, discovering the Joshua Tree Desert, and losing themselves on nameless roads and trails. Frantically making love all the time and almost everywhere, they regularly fight, then kiss and make up, with little else going on in their empty relationship and quite ordinary daily life--until something horrible and hideous brutally puts an end to their trip.", "popularity": "1.516165", "poster_path": "/alBCBzJaqgiYD1OWWzTueF1TKs4.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "3b productions", "id": 5609}, {"name": "The 7th Floor", "id": 5708}, {"name": "Thoke Moebius Film Company", "id": 87494}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "2003-09-17", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 114, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.3", "vote_count": "20"}
