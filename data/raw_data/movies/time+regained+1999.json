Looking at photographs brings memories of his childhood, his youth, his lovers, and the way the Great War put an end to a stratum of society. His memories are in no particular order, they move back and forth in time. Marcel at various ages interacts with Odette, with the beautiful Gilberte and her doomed husband, with the pleasure-seeking Baron de Charlus, with Marcel's lover Albertine, and with others; present also in memory are Marcel's beloved mother and grandmother. It seems as if to live is to remember and to capture memories is to create a work of great art. The memories parallel the final volume of Proust's novel.", "popularity": "1.548837", "poster_path": "/ylTWJkN5GkwxOCsJPaDmeOv87Ep.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "France 2 Cin\u00e9ma", "id": 83}, {"name": "Les Films du Lendemain", "id": 1249}, {"name": "Gemini Films", "id": 6584}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}, {"iso_3166_1": "PT", "name": "Portugal"}], "release_date": "1999-05-19", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 169, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.3", "vote_count": "11"}
