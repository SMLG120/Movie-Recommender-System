Although it won an Oscar for Best Documentary, it is fiction. It was intended as an hour-long program to air on BBC 1, but it was deemed too intense and violent to broadcast. It went to theatrical distribution as a feature film instead. Low-budget and shot on location, it strives for and achieves convincing and unflinching realism.", "popularity": "1.761241", "poster_path": "/pjDA4DDG9YB2Pu8kxuD5jdUyO62.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)", "id": 3324}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "1965-11-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 48, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.8", "vote_count": "32"}
