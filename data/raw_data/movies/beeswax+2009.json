Jeannie co-owns a vintage clothing store with Amanda, a semi-estranged friend who she fears is trying to end their partnership. Lauren leads a looser, less tethered existence and is considering getting out of the country altogether. When Jeannie receives an email from Amanda threatening a lawsuit, she calls her law student ex-boyfriend Merrill for help. Eager for distraction from his own problems, he begins helping the sisters with theirs. Imbued with an innate charm, Beeswax is a story about families, friends, lovers and those awkward moments that bring all of them together.", "popularity": "0.528434", "poster_path": "/9Hzt0ktvFYPRToadaoEAmYAjP0q.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2009-08-09", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 100, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.4", "vote_count": "7"}
