When fate places Remy in the sewers of Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant made famous by his culinary hero, Auguste Gusteau. Despite the apparent dangers of being an unlikely - and certainly unwanted - visitor in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant, Remy's passion for cooking soon sets into motion a hilarious and exciting rat race that turns the culinary world of Paris upside down.", "popularity": "20.50803", "poster_path": "/jEiEU8viSb8CIIHcfprVr2V6XDz.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Walt Disney Pictures", "id": 2}, {"name": "Pixar Animation Studios", "id": 3}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2007-06-22", "revenue": "623722818", "runtime": 111, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.5", "vote_count": "4510"}
