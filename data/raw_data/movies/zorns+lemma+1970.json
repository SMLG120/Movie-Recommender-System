It is named after Zorn's lemma (also known as the Kuratowski\u2013Zorn lemma), a proposition of set theory formulated by mathematician Max Zorn in 1935.  Zorns Lemma is prefaced with a reading from an early grammar textbook. The remainder of the film, largely silent, shows the viewer an evolving 24-part \"alphabet\" (composed initially of street signs photographed in New York City) which is cycled through, replaced and expanded upon. The film's conclusion shows a man, woman and dog walking through snow as several voices read passages from On Light, or the Ingression of Forms, by Robert Grosseteste.", "popularity": "0.772591", "poster_path": "/ovAeLJTYnYk4Uihg1OqT1SSEmLI.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1970-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 60, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.0", "vote_count": "5"}
