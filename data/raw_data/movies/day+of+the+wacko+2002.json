Adam Miauczynski, the character known from director Marek Koterski's previous films, is a 44 year-old teacher, who reads poetry during school lessons and later goes home swearing and calling his neighbours' names. The worst pain for him is the next 5 minutes of living. He doesn't accept himself and even everyday contacts with others cause his aggression. Though constantly dreaming of a romantic love, he is not bold enough to make his dreams come true. The desperate Miauczynski personalizes our own fears and obsessions, which have become so visible recently.", "popularity": "2.699622", "poster_path": "/sr2XlP4OHB3Oaja3gXhS6KA52ir.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "PL", "name": "Poland"}], "release_date": "2002-07-07", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 93, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "pl", "name": "Polski"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.2", "vote_count": "29"}
