For seven years, she has refused to name the father. A vigorous older stranger arrives, recognized by Hester but unknown to others as her missing husband. He poses as Chillingworth, a doctor, watching Hester and searching out the identity of her lover. His eye soon rests on Dimmesdale, a young overwrought pastor. Enmity grows between the two men; Chillingworth applies psychological pressure, and the pastor begins to crack. A ship stops in Salem, and Hester sees it as a providential refuge for her daughter, herself, and her lover. But will Dimmesdale flee with her?", "popularity": "0.24152", "poster_path": "/y0YsI97cGxWDOA9ydnZHIfaAwmi.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR)", "id": 7025}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "ES", "name": "Spain"}], "release_date": "1973-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.0", "vote_count": "3"}
