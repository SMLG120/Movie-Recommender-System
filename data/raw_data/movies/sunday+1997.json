Madeleine the most unsettling creature of that name since \"Vertigo\" is a middle-aged, moderately successful actress. Oliver/Matthew is either a homeless man or a famous film director or both. Madeleine hails him on the street as the latter, launching a bizarre chain of events that includes a conversation in a diner, a very unromantic sexual encounter, the arrival of Madeleine's odd husband and unsuspecting daughter, and a child's birthday party. The film also compassionately tracks the daily rounds of Oliver/Matthew's fellow denizens of the homeless shelter, some of whom will be recognizable to New York audiences.", "popularity": "0.29962", "poster_path": "/1vRlNbRnfYWw5gFKqggL0VyxdNR.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Sunday Productions", "id": 40423}, {"name": "Goatworks Films", "id": 40424}, {"name": "Ocelot Films Inc.", "id": 40425}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1997-08-27", "revenue": "288", "runtime": 91, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.3", "vote_count": "3"}
