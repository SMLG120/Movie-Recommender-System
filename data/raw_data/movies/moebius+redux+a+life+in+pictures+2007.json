He achieved his greatest fame as Moebius - not so much a pseudonym as an alter ego. With his triple-split personality - Jean Giraud, Moebius, Gir - he succeeded in making his work accessible in popular comic strip series like Blueberry, in metaphysical fantasies like John Difool and, not least, to a broad public, with set designs for films such as The Fifth Element. In Moebius Redux - A Life in Pictures an exceptional artist tells his life's and work's story. Extraordinary views on Paris, Los Angeles and the Mexican desert build a visual link between his life and his artistic universe, accompanied by the electronic soundtrack composed by \"Kraftwerk\" legend Karl Bartos.", "popularity": "0.431208", "poster_path": "/b8ces2j58jnYJJOkbHRctrILbET.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Arte", "id": 201}, {"name": "ZDF/Arte", "id": 11237}, {"name": "Morag Loves Company", "id": 33137}, {"name": "Avanti Media", "id": 71291}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}], "release_date": "2007-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 68, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "0.0", "vote_count": "0"}
