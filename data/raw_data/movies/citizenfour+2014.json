She brought her camera with her. The film that resulted from this series of tense encounters is absolutely sui generis in the history of cinema:  a 100eal-life thriller unfolding minute by minute before our eyes. Poitras is a great and brave filmmaker, but she is also a masterful storyteller: she compresses the many days of questioning, waiting, confirming, watching the world\u2019s reaction and agonizing over the next move, into both a great character study of Snowden and a narrative that will leave you on the edge of your seat as it inexorably moves toward its conclusion.", "popularity": "6.584217", "poster_path": "/yNuLhb2y6I5cO7BfiJ7bdfllnIG.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Participant Media", "id": 6735}, {"name": "HBO Documentary Films", "id": 17980}, {"name": "Praxis Films", "id": 46226}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2014-10-10", "revenue": "3003169", "runtime": 114, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "pt", "name": "Portugu\u00eas"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.9", "vote_count": "516"}
