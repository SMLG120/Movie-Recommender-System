Now thirty-three, he still does not speak. (He does express himself through colourful suits that would challenge any Wes Anderson character in nerd chic.) Paul's aunts have only one dream for him: to win piano competitions. Although Paul practices dutifully, he remains unfulfilled until he submits to the interventions of his upstairs neighbour. Suitably named after the novelist, Madame Proust offers Paul a concoction that unlocks repressed memories from his childhood and awakens the most delightful of fantasies.", "popularity": "2.044356", "poster_path": "/foQSCFIWoxQWbtuUgShZipHxlPb.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Pathe Communications", "id": 1800}, {"name": "Pathe", "id": 7396}, {"name": "Eurowide Film Production", "id": 7627}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "2013-11-06", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 106, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.6", "vote_count": "21"}
