Bruno, a rich bachelor, the head of a successful greeting-card company in Scotland, is essentially a kind man but respectable to the point of stodginess and extreme stuffiness. An American troupe visiting Edinburgh wants to produce a musical in town but has trouble getting backers. Bruno meets several of the leading ladies of the show; through a misunderstanding he doesn't correct they think that he's a newspaper reporter. He falls in love with one of the women, who reciprocates; he grows more lively and friendly, to the surprise of his employees. After a series of mishaps and comic incidents comes a happy ending: a successful show and true love.", "popularity": "0.074823", "poster_path": "/y6IvKB3BrpPL4V0IlZ8zEmVQTfG.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Marcel Hellman Productions", "id": 19852}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "1951-03-06", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 97, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.0", "vote_count": "1"}
