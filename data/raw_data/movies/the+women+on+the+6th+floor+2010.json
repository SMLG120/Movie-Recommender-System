Jean-Louis Joubert is a serious but uptight stockbroker, married to Suzanne, a starchy class-conscious woman and father of two arrogant teenage boys, currently in a boarding school. The affluent man lives a steady yet boring life. At least until, due to fortuitous circumstances, Maria, the charming new maid at the service of Jean-Louis' family, makes him discover the servants' quarter on the sixth floor of the luxury building he owns and lives in. There live a crowd of lively Spanish maids who will help Jean-Louis to open to a new civilization and a new approach of life. In their company - and more precisely in the company of beautiful Maria - Jean-Louis will gradually become another man, a better man.", "popularity": "3.653474", "poster_path": "/bNoGZEhXCxFm1n9RiOteF5Pb0Mz.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "France 2 Cin\u00e9ma", "id": 83}, {"name": "SND", "id": 2902}, {"name": "Canal+", "id": 5358}, {"name": "Vend\u00f4me Production", "id": 23291}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "2010-12-20", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 106, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.6", "vote_count": "90"}
