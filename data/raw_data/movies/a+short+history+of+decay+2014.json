When she unceremoniously dumps him, Nathan retreats into a depressive funk, not knowing where to turn-- finish the novel? work on the play?-- when he gets a call from his brother in Florida telling him his father has been hospitalized. Racing down to \"snowbird\" central, Nathan finds his father (Yulin) on the mend (albeit grumpy), and his normally addled mother (Lavin) a bit hazier than usual. His quick visit turns into an extended stay during which he discovers that his aging parents are actually in much better control of their lives than he is. He also meets a woman (Perkins)--his mother's manicurist, no less-- who is the polar opposite of Erika, but who may just be exactly what Nathan needs.", "popularity": "0.660643", "poster_path": "/bFTeE3HZyA7cTAGjOOZTwGdvyL.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "HU", "name": "Hungary"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2014-05-16", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 94, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "hu", "name": "Magyar"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.0", "vote_count": "2"}
