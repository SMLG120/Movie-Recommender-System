The family is warmly welcome, but these are the years of political anarchy and leftist/rightist clashes in big cities and the youth of the village inevitably follow the tides. They arrive in Vizontele, just as the situation is becoming really absurd. Guner brings wisdom; his daughter Tuba brings beauty, innocence and love. Some like the Mayor, Nazmi Dogan and crazy Emin appreciate these things but they are in the minority and confusion continues to reign. The story is based on the memories of writer-director Y\u0131lmaz Erdo\u011fan of the last summer of his childhood in Hakk\u00e2ri, Turkey in 1980.", "popularity": "0.808339", "poster_path": "/6fx8nkNgRNscOslKE9zA0Hovhtf.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Besiktas K\u00fclt\u00fcr Merkezi (BKM)", "id": 25350}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "TR", "name": "Turkey"}], "release_date": "2004-01-21", "revenue": "13954476", "runtime": 111, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "tr", "name": "T\u00fcrk\u00e7e"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.5", "vote_count": "9"}
