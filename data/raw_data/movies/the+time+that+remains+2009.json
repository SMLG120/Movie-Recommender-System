The film is inspired by my father\u2019s diaries of his personal accounts, starting from when he was a resistant fighter in 1948, and by my mother\u2019s letters to family members who were forced to leave the country since then. Combined with my intimate memories of them and with them, the film attempts to portray the daily life of those Palestinians who remained in their land and were labeled \"Israeli-Arabs,\" living as a minority in their own homeland.", "popularity": "0.635053", "poster_path": "/ncINxlOnHtt9xG3bW4TJay1oVVX.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "France 3 Cin\u00e9ma", "id": 591}, {"name": "nazira", "id": 6610}, {"name": "Nazira", "id": 6611}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "BE", "name": "Belgium"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2009-08-12", "revenue": "753808", "runtime": 109, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ar", "name": "\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "he", "name": "\u05e2\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.3", "vote_count": "9"}
