When the young and overly sensitive filmmaker Julien screens his new DV art-film starring his girlfriend Lili (Swimming Pool's Ludivine Sagnier) --a sexy young local girl--to his famous actress mother Mado, and her lover Brice, an accomplished film director, an unraveling of the delicate peace in their house begins. The graceful beauty Lili, who dreams of becoming a famous actress like Mado, is immediately fascinated by Brice, who gladly falls prey to her charms.", "popularity": "1.222277", "poster_path": "/mutuSNsTwBrLKjLOzZ68MAp7OJH.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Cin\u00e9maginaire Inc.", "id": 280}, {"name": "Les Films Alain Sarde", "id": 635}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}], "release_date": "2003-08-27", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 104, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.6", "vote_count": "7"}
