What's the street-level experience of voters in today's America? In a triumph of documentary storytelling, ELECTION DAY combines eleven stories--all shot simultaneously on November 2, 2004, from dawn until long past midnight--into one. Factory workers, ex-felons, harried moms, Native American activists and diligent poll watchers, from South Dakota to Florida, take the process of democracy into their own hands. The result: an entertaining, inspiring and sometimes unsettling tapestry of citizens determined on one fateful day to make their votes count.", "popularity": "0.080013", "poster_path": "/5QhImK4IA6KD7hu1y6Co5qWdGlG.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2007-03-10", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 84, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "0.0", "vote_count": "0"}
