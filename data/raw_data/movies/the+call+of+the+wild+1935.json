His luck changes when he pays $250 for Buck, a sled dog that is part wolf to keep him from being shot by an arrogant Englishman also headed for the Yukon. En route to the Yukon with Shorty Houlihan -- who spent time in jail for opening someone else's letter with a map of where gold is to be found -- Jack rescues a woman whose husband was the addressee of that letter. Buck helps Jack win a $1,000 bet to get the supplies he needs. And when Jack and Claire Blake pet Buck one night, fingers touch.", "popularity": "1.061454", "poster_path": "/yhlz8WV0BhlgkPVy4AAceFmlpAX.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "20th Century Pictures", "id": 4985}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1935-08-09", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 81, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.0", "vote_count": "13"}
