Henie plays a Norwegian refugee adopted by band pianist John Payne, who mistakenly thought that the full-grown Miss Henie was a 10-year-old little girl. Payne's girlfriend, Lynn Bari, is a soloist with the Miller band, and also a violently jealous sort. When Bari quits Miller out of pique, Henie stages an elaborate ice show as a substitute. This impromptu spectacular thrills the audience at the Sun Valley resort hotel where most of the action takes place. Joan Davis and Milton Berle provide comic relief to the music and romance (you haven't lived until you've seen Berle on skis), while The Nicholas Brothers and Dorothy Dandridge perform a lively chorus of \"Chattanooga Choo Choo.\"", "popularity": "0.77811", "poster_path": "/vMMrecFRLIomyRI9dWxhgjfyicI.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation", "id": 306}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1941-08-29", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 86, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.0", "vote_count": "3"}
