Rich, elderly Don Alejo is poised to sell the town for a profit, needing only to buy a whorehouse to own all the buildings and close the deal. It's owned by a man and his daughter: Manuelita is gay, aging, afraid; he cross-dresses and entertains as a flamenco dancer; he wants to sell and leave. His daughter wants to stay. The return of Pancho complicates things: he's a hothead Alejo tries to control and he scared Manuelita the year before. Things come to a head as Pancho breaks Alejo's hold on him, then flirts and dances with Manuelita and finds himself at risk of being called a \"maric\u00f3n.\"", "popularity": "0.000308", "poster_path": "/xjhalcMhYcrSxxlMjlj94pq0JPK.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Conacite Dos", "id": 5001}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "MX", "name": "Mexico"}], "release_date": "1978-04-28", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 110, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.3", "vote_count": "6"}
