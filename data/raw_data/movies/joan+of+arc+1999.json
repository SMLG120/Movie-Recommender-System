Six years later, from the village of Domremy, she begins her mission to unite France under King Charles. First she leads a defense of Vaucouleurs against the Burgundians, then obtains safe passage to Charles, the Dauphin. He uses her, as the embodiment of the mythical \"Maid of Lorraine,\" to raise an army, and he sends her to the rescue of Orl\u00e9ans. After Charles is crowned, Joan leads a disastrous campaign in Paris, where her brother dies. Then she's the victim of Charles's manipulations: she's captured in Burgundy, sold to the English, examined by Bishop Cauchon, found a heretic by the Inquisition, and burned at the stake.", "popularity": "2.045494", "poster_path": "/x6vssAd2A102zFB7A5UShjkYSm7.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}], "release_date": "1999-05-16", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 140, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.7", "vote_count": "22"}
