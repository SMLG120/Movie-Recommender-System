The film explores a long line of degrading images of Arabs--from Bedouin bandits and submissive maidens to sinister sheikhs and gun-wielding \"terrorists\"--along the way offering devastating insights into the origin of these stereotypic images, their development at key points in US history, and why they matter so much today.", "popularity": "0.263374", "poster_path": "/alUcviVEaQo0cvgOLiDopwhqPDJ.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2006-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 50, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.9", "vote_count": "6"}
