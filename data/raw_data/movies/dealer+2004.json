His clients include the leader of a religious sect, a friend who needs a final fix, a former lover who has had his child, a student, and a black marketeer. Fliegauf's film recreates life in a city that resembles a ghost town, an alienated world with its own priorities and realities. It is, he says '. an imaginary city with a strongly spiritualist atmosphere. This necropolis is the film's real protagonist'.", "popularity": "0.457814", "poster_path": "/9GCPef3vIBp9mwfIfT8cdJzyGcl.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "HU", "name": "Hungary"}], "release_date": "2004-02-11", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 136, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "hu", "name": "Magyar"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.0", "vote_count": "1"}
