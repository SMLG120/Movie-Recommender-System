She works a dreadful, dead-end job under an awful boss, is intimidated by her well-off peers, and nagged incessantly by her overbearing mother who is exasperated by the fact that her daughter is not married or even in a relationship. The only joys in her life come from a grainy VHS tape \u2013 an American film in which a man buries a satchel of money in the snowy Midwestern plains - and her beloved pet rabbit, Bunzo. Kumiko is somehow convinced that this treasure is real, and obsesses over its discovery.  With a hand-stitched treasure map and a quixotic spirit, Kumiko embarks on an incredible journey over the Pacific and through the frozen Minnesota wilderness to uncover a purported fortune.", "popularity": "4.580804", "poster_path": "/3PvhdMaJY4QrnjahZXwYfH6Hov3.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Ad Hominem Enterprises", "id": 2361}, {"name": "Lila 9th Productions", "id": 7633}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2015-02-20", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 105, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.4", "vote_count": "104"}
