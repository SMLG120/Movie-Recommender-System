The appearance of a true character distinguished it from earlier animated \"trick films\", such as those of Blackton and Cohl, and makes it the predecessor to later popular cartoons such as those by Walt Disney. The film was also the first to be created using keyframe animation.", "popularity": "1.914726", "poster_path": "/6zQNAso7pVpVUPVLIv86bsbDlUW.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Vitagraph Company of America", "id": 15634}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1914-09-15", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 12, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.7", "vote_count": "27"}
