CRY OF THE SNOW LION brings audiences to the long-forbidden \"rooftop of the world\" with an unprecedented richness of imagery... from rarely-seen rituals in remote monasteries, to horse races with Khamba warriors; from brothels and slums in the holy city of Lhasa, to magnificent Himalayan peaks still traveled by nomadic yak caravans. The dark secrets of Tibet's recent past are powerfully chronicled through personal stories and interviews, and a collection of undercover and archival images never before assembled in one film. A definitive exploration of a legendary subject, CRY OF THE SNOW LION is an epic story of courage and compassion", "popularity": "0.152361", "poster_path": "/pHiFVRoqvchwjdUmh7VDFhKv1Oo.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2002-09-13", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 104, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Rumored", "vote_average": "8.0", "vote_count": "4"}
