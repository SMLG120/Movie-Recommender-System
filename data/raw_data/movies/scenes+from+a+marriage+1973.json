We first meet them ten years into their marriage. He is a college professor, she a divorce lawyer. They say that they are happily married - unlike their friends Katarina and Peter who openly fight, especially when under the influence of alcohol - but there is a certain detached aloofness in the way they treat each other. In the next ten years, as they contemplate or embark upon divorce and/or known extramarital affairs, they come to differing understandings at each phase of their relationship of what they truly mean to each other. Regardless of if it's love or hate - between which there is a fine line - they also come to certain understandings of how they can best relate to each other, whether that be as husband and wife, friends, lovers or none of the above.", "popularity": "2.845693", "poster_path": "/nr87dK7xn8qeJiwYoL2DVJ9WhTm.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Cinematograph AB", "id": 7445}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "SE", "name": "Sweden"}], "release_date": "1973-04-11", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 283, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "sv", "name": "svenska"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "8.3", "vote_count": "44"}
