To remedy this predicament he sends his son Alfred off on a hunting trip. On the trip, in the midst of many follies brought on by his inexperience with the outdoors, he meets a young mountain girl and falls in love with her. Alfred's butler, who has accompanied him on the outing, is sent to arrange the marriage with the girl's father, who thinks Alfred is too weak to become a member of the family. In an attempt to change the father's mind, the butler tells the girl's father and brother that Alfred is actually Alfred \"Battling\" Butler, a professional boxer. The deception works and a wedding is arranged. Comic mischief ensues as Alfred and his butler attempt to make their newly fabricated story seem plausible to the family of his new bride.", "popularity": "1.09569", "poster_path": "/7MVdo4OyzIcwycN58J9n855ggoS.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Buster Keaton Productions", "id": 12190}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1926-09-19", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 77, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.7", "vote_count": "13"}
