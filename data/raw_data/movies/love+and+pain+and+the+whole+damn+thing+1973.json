Set in Spain, the film stars Timothy Bottoms as the aimless son of doctor Charles Baxter. While bicycling through the Spanish countryside, Charles makes the acquaintance of much-older Lila (Maggie Smith.) He falls in love with her, but she is resistant. Eventually touched by Charles' clumsy sincerity, Lila invites him to bed. The film then wanders into Love Story territory when Lila is afflicted by a terminal illness. Director Alan J. Pakula completed Love and Pain and the Whole Damn Thing during the \"cooling off\" period between his more famous Klute (1971) and The Parallax View (1974).", "popularity": "0.080589", "poster_path": "/a5tfRPV4Zl1Pd7OIs0XGhMG3ZhN.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Columbia Pictures Corporation", "id": 441}, {"name": "Gus Productions", "id": 6174}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1973-04-19", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 110, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.0", "vote_count": "1"}
