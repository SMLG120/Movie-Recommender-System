Penned like animals, on the top floor of a deserted high-rise block, these two opposing gangs find that they are not alone in the lair of bloodthirsty corridors of death. Joining forces to survive, they must reach ground level together or perish. Loaded with a bad ass attitude, guns, axes and extremely creative hand-to-hand combat sequences that project the fears and paranoia that are the fighting forces behind the need to survive, when caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time.", "popularity": "5.319546", "poster_path": "/qcRQnEGeco8RZqzD1vyrPaBa6z2.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Le Pacte", "id": 5125}, {"name": "Capture The Flag Films", "id": 5666}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "2009-08-28", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.7", "vote_count": "104"}
