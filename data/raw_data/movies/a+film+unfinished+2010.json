The later discovery of a long-missing reel complicated earlier readings, showing the manipulations of camera crews in these \"everyday\" scenes. Well-heeled Jews attending elegant dinners and theatricals (while callously stepping over the dead bodies of compatriots) now appeared as unwilling, but complicit, actors, alternately fearful and in denial of their looming fate.", "popularity": "0.488031", "poster_path": "/ty02kIkonEFvMLjLEHQb3OVOj9n.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IL", "name": "Israel"}, {"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}], "release_date": "2010-08-18", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 89, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "he", "name": "\u05e2\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea"}, {"iso_639_1": "pl", "name": "Polski"}, {"iso_639_1": "yi", "name": ""}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.3", "vote_count": "11"}
