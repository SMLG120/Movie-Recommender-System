Actually, Wood does not appear much in this film. Rather, it centers on the lives and thoughts of his entourage and those who knew him. Among those interviewed are Wood's former lover and star of his earliest films, Dolores Fuller, whom he abruptly replaced in the middle of Bride of the Monster with actress Loretta King who is also interviewed.", "popularity": "0.037443", "poster_path": "/rarwGANB2L4EcxInVw1Q8TgcfU1.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Wood-Thomas Pictures", "id": 33624}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1996-05-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 112, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "10.0", "vote_count": "1"}
