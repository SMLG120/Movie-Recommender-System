His journey across the vast country takes him to a whiskey distillery in Kentucky, a brothel in Nevada, an Amish community in Wisconsin and the lava fields in Hawaii. He also goes hunting in New York State, sailing on an America's Cup yacht in Rhode Island, basket weaving with Navajo Indians and meets environmental activists in Oregon. Proud citizens show Stephen their country as he drives across the continent, uncovering the differences that make each state individual and the similarities that make America distinct.", "popularity": "0.05048", "poster_path": "/xUDWur4WTIwBZirtZQP3GMacR5g.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "null", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 59, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "8.0", "vote_count": "1"}
