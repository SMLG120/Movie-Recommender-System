Allen's cowardice serves him well when he hides in a cannon and is shot into a tent of French soldiers, making him a national hero. A hilarious parody of Russian literature, Love and Death is a must-see for fans of Allen's films.", "popularity": "5.165666", "poster_path": "/qRNisGLmcHoEvMjzcvVlcdCnOhO.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "United Artists", "id": 60}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1975-06-10", "revenue": "20173742", "runtime": 85, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.5", "vote_count": "176"}
