But these two, three, ten plot lines unfold from what the characters hide or just don\u2019t know, connecting the writing of the novel and the forming of the gang, and the past of two of the characters with that of the house, and of those who perhaps were the two most bitter enemies of nineteenth century Argentine history.", "popularity": "0.0953", "poster_path": "/AfrN35qyVkEErcbJe0V48riSHJ9.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Alta Definicion", "id": 52606}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "AR", "name": "Argentina"}], "release_date": "2009-03-28", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 75, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.5", "vote_count": "2"}
