Howl, the film, recounts this dark moment using three interwoven threads: the tumultuous life events that led a young Allen Ginsberg to find his true voice as an artist, society's reaction (the obscenity trial), and mind-expanding animation that echoes the startling originality of the poem itself. All three coalesce in a genre-bending hybrid that brilliantly captures a pivotal moment-the birth of a counterculture.", "popularity": "5.416588", "poster_path": "/oc5MVYd2hzvt76Oa4IoFnaxLkht.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "RabbitBandini Productions", "id": 8924}, {"name": "Werc Werk Works", "id": 53303}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2010-08-26", "revenue": "617000", "runtime": 84, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.8", "vote_count": "68"}
