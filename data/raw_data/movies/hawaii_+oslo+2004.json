We follow Leon, an institutionalized kleptomaniac who is loking for \u00c5sa, to whom he has a ten year old deal to get married. We meet Leon's brother, Trygve, who fetches Leon at the institution to celebrate his birthday, but who himself has plans to use his leave from prison to run away. And most of all we meet the angel Vidar, Leon's best buddy at the institution, who sees things no one else can see, and who may be able to save everyone - except himself?", "popularity": "1.749024", "poster_path": "/uGpPiYt5uD4XtLrl0ZLCp6LEdiD.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Paradox Spillefilm A/S", "id": 2966}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DK", "name": "Denmark"}, {"iso_3166_1": "NO", "name": "Norway"}, {"iso_3166_1": "SE", "name": "Sweden"}], "release_date": "2004-09-24", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 125, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "no", "name": "Norsk"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.3", "vote_count": "18"}
