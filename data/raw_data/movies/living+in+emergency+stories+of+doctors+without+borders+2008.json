With different levels of experience, each volunteer must find their own way to face the challenges, the tough choices, and the limits of their idealism. \"Living in Emergency\" is a window into the seldom portrayed and less-than glamorous side of humanitarian aid work. It explores a world that is challenging, complex, and fraught with dilemmas - the struggles, both internal and external, that aid workers face when working in war zones and other difficult contexts.", "popularity": "0.051896", "poster_path": "/4fHlraq0KAlrNW10PCQWaVJDye9.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2008-08-29", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 93, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "9.0", "vote_count": "1"}
