By early 1917, the average life-span of a British pilot is less than a fortnight. Such losses place a fearsome strain on Gresham, commanding officer of the squadron. Aces High recreates the early days of the Royal Flying Corps with some magnificently staged aerial battles, and sensitive direction presents a moving portrayal of the futilities of war.", "popularity": "1.733978", "poster_path": "/coRnJc0WXzkMMJu0CRZVJsDmazA.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Les Productions Jacques Roitfeld", "id": 1527}, {"name": "S.
