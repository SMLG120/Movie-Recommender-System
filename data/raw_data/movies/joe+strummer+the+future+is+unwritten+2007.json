Four years after his death, his influence reaches out around the world, more strongly now than ever before. In \"The Future Is Unwritten\", from British film director Julien Temple, Joe Strummer is revealed not just as a legend or musician, but as a true communicator of our times. Drawing on both a shared punk history and the close personal friendship which developed over the last years of Joe's life, Julien Temple's film is a celebration of Joe Strummer - before, during and after the Clash.", "popularity": "2.388657", "poster_path": "/1o2vTPVzHEHU3q9RxJAkCY0a3mG.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Filmfour", "id": 6705}, {"name": "Parallel Film Productions", "id": 16486}, {"name": "Sony BMG Feature Films", "id": 37764}, {"name": "Nitrate Films", "id": 43790}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IE", "name": "Ireland"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2007-05-18", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 123, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.3", "vote_count": "20"}
