But before he was famous, before WikiLeaks, before the internet even existed, he was a teenage computer hacker in Melbourne. This is his story.  In 1989, known as \u2018Mendax\u2019, Assange and two friends formed a group called the \u2018International Subversives\u2019. Using early home computers and defining themselves as \u2018white hat hackers\u2019 - those who look but don\u2019t steal \u2013 they broke into some of the world\u2019s most powerful and secretive organisations. They were young, brilliant, and in the eyes of the US Government, a major threat to national security.", "popularity": "2.125772", "poster_path": "/ifth4A9bgTsBLfOKt4MP59KIBoX.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Screen Australia", "id": 7584}, {"name": "Film Victoria", "id": 11840}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "AU", "name": "Australia"}], "release_date": "2012-10-07", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 89, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "cs", "name": "\u010cesk\u00fd"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "hu", "name": "Magyar"}, {"iso_639_1": "pl", "name": "Polski"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.8", "vote_count": "18"}
