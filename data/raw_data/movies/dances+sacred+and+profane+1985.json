Bare breasts, elaborately tattooed bodies and bizarre behavior are featured in his work, and in the movie.  Addressing those who may find his subject matter \"revolting and disgusting,\" Mr. Gatewood asserts that it \"tells us something about ourselves.\" He sees \"important statements being made there,\" about \"liberation through excess\" and \"some kind of actualization of transcendence.\"", "popularity": "0.000844", "poster_path": "/jymxBy2i7pQmvQqtM8YdWO0wUKG.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1985-10-16", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "0.0", "vote_count": "0"}
