The anonymous urban protagonist experiences a series of absurd situations--including a crazy cab ride, an encounter with a wacky criminal gang, and lots of gunplay--but they're stripped of any story that might explain them and infused with a unique anarchic energy, eventually suggesting our true animal nature. As with Godard, it's partly an homage to genre filmmaking (there's singing and dancing, a little sex, and lots of violence), but what really powers the film is Tonacci's inventive camera.", "popularity": "0.000578", "poster_path": "/946p57CEWnVSJC1mBuqixHTWuAD.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Total Filmes", "id": 93193}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "BR", "name": "Brazil"}], "release_date": "1971-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 80, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "pt", "name": "Portugu\u00eas"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.5", "vote_count": "2"}
