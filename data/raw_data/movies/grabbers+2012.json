First, some fishermen go missing. Then there is the rash of whale carcasses suddenly washing up on the beach. When the murders start, it\u2019s up to two mismatched cops \u2013 an irresponsible alcoholic and his new partner, a by-the-book woman from the mainland \u2013 to protect the townsfolk from the giant, bloodsucking, tentacled aliens that prey upon them.
