Til Schweiger comes up with a slickly-made off-the-wall romantic comedy drama \"Barfuss\" (Barefoot), his first solo directing effort in nearly a decade.  Punchy, anti-establishment tone, with Schweiger playing a hedonistic bachelor - he is his rich family's black sheep - who falls for a suicidal mental patient (Johanna Wokalek).  An offbeat, strangely tender love story develops as Nick struggles with responsibility for the first time in his life.", "popularity": "2.561207", "poster_path": "/aN4dn64CVkdYbCLroxspDHEFX9g.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Touchstone Pictures", "id": 9195}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}], "release_date": "2005-03-30", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 110, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "pl", "name": "Polski"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.7", "vote_count": "59"}
