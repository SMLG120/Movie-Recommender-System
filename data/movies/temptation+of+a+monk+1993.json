The crown prince is murdered by one of his brothers who then becomes emperor. Shi retreats to a monastery, perhaps to hide, perhaps to plan a coup. When his loyal troops as well as the princess he desires are slain, he seeks refuge in a remote, abandoned monastery where an aged abbot schools him with practical, earthy teachings. The emperor's forces pursue Shi: first a woman, then a general seek to overpower him with lust and might. Over the course of the film, the reds of battle give way to blues of meditation.", "popularity": "0.103153", "poster_path": "/79837tDUjBbDfwl7K7atVTb9Xi.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "HK", "name": "Hong Kong"}], "release_date": "1993-09-15", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 118, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "cn", "name": "\u5e7f\u5dde\u8bdd / \u5ee3\u5dde\u8a71"}, {"iso_639_1": "zh", "name": "\u666e\u901a\u8bdd"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.0", "vote_count": "2"}
