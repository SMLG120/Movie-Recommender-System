In the spring of 1988, they're in Kurdistan, at an isolated mountain clinic, waiting for an offensive. David's had enough - he wants to go home to Dublin to his pregnant wife. He leaves, with Mark promising to follow in a few days. A week or so later, Mark's home after being wounded, but David's not been heard from. Mark's slow recovery and uncharacteristic behavior alarm his girlfriend, Elena, who asks her grandfather, a Spanish psychologist, to come to Dublin to help. Are there things the carefree and detached journalist is bottling up? Is he a casualty of war?", "popularity": "9.51301", "poster_path": "/jsDRXesSf5nqwNbemFaEOZ81IPW.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Aramid Entertainment Fund", "id": 3272}, {"name": "Irish Film Board", "id": 5267}, {"name": "Tornasol Films", "id": 7680}, {"name": "Asap films", "id": 14819}, {"name": "Parallel Film Productions", "id": 16486}, {"name": "Freeform Spain", "id": 23191}, {"name": "Euroimages Fund of the Council of Europe", "id": 23192}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "BE", "name": "Belgium"}, {"iso_3166_1": "ES", "name": "Spain"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IE", "name": "Ireland"}], "release_date": "2009-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 99, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "ru", "name": "P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.3", "vote_count": "44"}
