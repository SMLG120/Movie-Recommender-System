He thinks she is plotting against him with their mutual psychiatrist. His dog is missing and he suspects the people at work might be behind it. Then there is the unshakable guilt over his past. It just might all be bearable, somehow possible to live through, if it weren't for those damned 'monsters' that keep trying to kill him. Through an allegorical 'fable' that is told in parallel with Joseph's struggle, we are left to decide for ourselves in the end, who is the crow and who is the wolf., was someone out to get Joseph, was it a stroke of bad luck, or was it all in his head?", "popularity": "0.006604", "poster_path": "/yy6yf68pB0J1hiDCCVunByzZ5NM.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2002-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 84, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "0.0", "vote_count": "0"}
