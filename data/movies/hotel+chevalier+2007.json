Depression? Ambiguity in a Paris hotel room. Jack Whitman lies on a bed, ordering a grilled cheese sandwich from room service. His phone rings; it's a woman on her way to see him, a surprise. He readies the room, moving without affect, drawing a bath, changing his clothes. She arrives, as does the food, and the complications of their relationship emerge in bits and pieces. He invites her out on the balcony to see his view. Will they make love? Is the relationship over?", "popularity": "4.933446", "poster_path": "/gr1Dd92kM1hxVwYtyYdcxs18ukg.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Fox Searchlight Pictures", "id": 43}, {"name": "American Empirical Pictures", "id": 23449}, {"name": "Premi\u00e8re Heure", "id": 70449}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2007-09-03", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 13, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.1", "vote_count": "204"}
