At least that was producer Pandro S. Berman's reasoning when he cast Pons in the 1935 musical romance I Dream too Much. The actress plays Annette, a rural French musical student who marries struggling American composer Jonathan (Henry Fonda). Possessed of a splendid singing voice, our heroine rises to fame on the opera stage, while poor Jonathan continues struggling, supporting himself as a tour guide. Annette eventually saves her marriage by transforming her husband's \"masterpiece,\" a rather turgid modernistic opera, into a light-hearted musical comedy. Lucille Ball, who'd later co-star with Henry Fonda in The Big Street and Yours, Mine and Ours, has a funny minor role as a gum-snapping tourist. Though Lily Pons was at least 10 years older than Fonda, they make an attractive and believable screen couple, adding credibility to this somewhat contrived yarn", "popularity": "0.953152", "poster_path": "/uLOcnN1Zv3sKQDVQ5hux96FKH5d.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "RKO Radio Pictures", "id": 6}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1935-11-29", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 97, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "3.0", "vote_count": "1"}
