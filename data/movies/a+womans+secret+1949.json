Marian has told the police that she shot Susan in a rage as Susan was giving up singing. Marian and Luke found Susan when she was a failure. A singer with a limited range, she was a diamond in the rough which Marian and Luke taught how to walk, dress and talk. With the singing lessons, Marian had hoped that she would have the career that Marian would have had if she had not lost her voice. Even though Susan is a scatterbrain girl, Luke does not believe that Marian would have been capable of shooting her. Luke hopes that Detective Fowler will be able to find out the truth and free Marian.", "popularity": "0.335752", "poster_path": "/cNzg7E8CSF1jlHmvdJarBbCWMz0.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "RKO Radio Pictures", "id": 6}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1949-03-05", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 84, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.0", "vote_count": "7"}
