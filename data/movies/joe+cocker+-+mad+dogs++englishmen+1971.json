Joe Cocker asked Leon to get some mates together as this tour was to get off the ground right away. For the most part Leon just pulled Delaney &amp; Bonnie's Band right out from under them. Jim Gordon, (who co-wrote LAYLA) Carl Radle and of course sometimes Leon. All were with Delaney and Bonnie. I might add at this time that Claudia Linnear who solo's on Let It Be is the girl who Mick Jagger wrote Brown Sugar about. If you listen to the sound of Delaney &amp; Bonnie's albums you will here the Mad Dogs sound. Donna Wiess is a great writer of music and has worked with Rita Coolidge off and on over the years.", "popularity": "0.035284", "poster_path": "/2Gc4WHtxmGQBu7P2XKpclIz4fkl.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "A&M Films", "id": 11043}, {"name": "Creative Film Associates", "id": 95355}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1971-08-27", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 117, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "10.0", "vote_count": "1"}
