Unpolished and ultra-pragmatic industrialist Jean-Jacques Castella (co-scripter Jean-Pierre Bacri) reluctantly attends Racine's tragedy \"Berenice\" in order to see his niece play a bit part. He is taken with the play's strangely familiar-looking leading lady Clara Devaux (Anne Alvaro). During the course of the show, Castella soon remembers that he once hired and then promptly fired the actress as an English language tutor. He immediately goes out and signs up for language lessons. Thinking that he is nothing but an ill-tempered philistine with bad taste, Clara rejects him until Castella charms her off her feet.", "popularity": "3.134181", "poster_path": "/yZg369hkTUTJ47nKJsqwCsNVQbA.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "France 2 Cin\u00e9ma", "id": 83}, {"name": "Canal+", "id": 5358}, {"name": "Les Films A4", "id": 84516}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "2000-03-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 112, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.6", "vote_count": "48"}
