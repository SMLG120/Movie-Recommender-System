It's hard to depict methamphetamine use with any sensitivity, but this movie's dry and frank style bring this plague into startling focus. It's very compassionate and gives a lot of context and insight into how Gay culture and drug culture meet. It is heartbreaking to know that the majority of the men interviewed for this movie are HIV-positive. This movie includes graphic sexual content and vivid depictions of drug use, but it serves a very valuable purpose. it is an eloquent call for social responsibility.", "popularity": "0.004174", "poster_path": "null", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2006-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 79, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "0.0", "vote_count": "0"}
