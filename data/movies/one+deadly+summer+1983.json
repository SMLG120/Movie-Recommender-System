Everyone notices the provocative Eliane. She singles out Pin-Pon and soon is crying on his shoulder (she's myopic and hates her reputation as a dunce and as easy); she moves in with him, knits baby clothes, and plans their wedding. Is this love or some kind of plot? She asks Pin-Pon's mother and aunt about the piano in the barn: who delivered it on a November night in 1955? Why does she want to know, and what does it have to do with her mother's sorrows, her father's injury, this quick marriage, and the last name on her birth certificate?", "popularity": "1.786832", "poster_path": "/xdwk5bEuNI29Ot0gkJlNtkPwH4Q.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "TF1 Films Productions", "id": 356}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1983-05-11", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 130, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.1", "vote_count": "28"}
