Lost souls, they meet one night by a quay; she may be thinking of suicide. He invites her to his caf\u00e9, and perhaps he will rescue her from the cabaret where she's under contract to a vicious mob leader. When the boss insists on her return, J\u00f4ji is bitter. He also despairs over lost dreams. His brother has gone to Brazil to purchase a farm; J\u00f4ji planned to join him but now believes his brother abandoned him. When J\u00f4ji discovers a clue about his brother, he needs Saeko's help. Like a fighter in the ring, he pursues the truth relentlessly, without regard for his own safety.
