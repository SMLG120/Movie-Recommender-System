The hero, having indirectly caused the death of his beloved, stubbornly tries to resurrect her spirit by devoting himself to painting and sculpture. Epstein conveys the twilight zone between life and death with lingering dissolves and brilliant utilization of slow motion.", "popularity": "1.229788", "poster_path": "/rx9LxiWt97vWzt7eWy07bMP7ram.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Films Jean Epstein", "id": 8994}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1928-10-04", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 63, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.5", "vote_count": "23"}
