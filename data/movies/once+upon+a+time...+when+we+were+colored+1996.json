Despite this, we see the life of the community in all its joys and sorrows, of those that live there while others decide to leave for a better life north. For those remaining, things come to a serious situation when one prominent businessman is being muscled out by a white competitor using racist intimidation. In response, the community must make the decision of whether to submit meekly like they always have, or finally fight for their rights.", "popularity": "0.252287", "poster_path": "/tsJSlkFSZPQhhVuKrYJXNClYaPD.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "BET Pictures", "id": 38196}, {"name": "United Image Entertainme", "id": 38197}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1996-01-26", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 115, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "4.5", "vote_count": "2"}
