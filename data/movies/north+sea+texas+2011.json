Life here smells of cold French fries, cheap cigarettes, vermouth and stale beer. Mother Yvette uses her friend Etienne, with his lousy grey Fiat, as a driver for the nights she has to \u201cperform\u201d.  As a kid Pim dreams of a better life, imagining princesses and beauty queens. But when Pim turns 16 he dreams of Gino, the handsome boy next door, instead. Ever since they were children there has been this tension between them. Now Gino is Pim\u2019s motorcycling hero. Cold mockery, little humiliations and tiny bits of hope make up Pim\u2019s life. No wonder he sometimes flees to his dream world.", "popularity": "5.599257", "poster_path": "/bc24mpqkZs3rWA4fGmne1Zxa5fD.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "E\u00e9n", "id": 7610}, {"name": "Mollywood", "id": 22071}, {"name": "Vlaams Audiovisueel Fonds", "id": 39515}, {"name": "Indeed films", "id": 93110}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "BE", "name": "Belgium"}], "release_date": "2011-03-16", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 96, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "nl", "name": "Nederlands"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.9", "vote_count": "59"}
