Thirty years after bands like the Ramones and the Sex Pistols infamously shocked the system with their hard, fast, status-quo-killing rock, the longest-running punk band in history is drawing bigger crowds than ever, \"pop-punk\" bands have found success on MTV, and kids too young to drive are forming bands that carry the torch for punk's raw, immediate sound. Meanwhile, \"punk\" has become a marketing concept to sell everything from cars to vodka, and dyed hair and piercings mark a rite of passage for thousands of kids.", "popularity": "0.408705", "poster_path": "/lZSc7YIQoPGATv9DYLb9DGsmtxL.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Aberration Films", "id": 5617}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "UM", "name": "United States Minor Outlying Islands"}], "release_date": "2007-07-27", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 93, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.3", "vote_count": "7"}
