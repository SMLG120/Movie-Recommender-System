El Topo (the mole) claims to be God, while dressed as a gunfighter in black, riding a horse through a spiritual, mystical landscape strewn with old Western movie, and ancient Eastern religious symbols. Bandits slaughtered a village on his path, so El Topo avenges the massacred, then forcibly takes their leader's woman Mara as his. El Topo's surreal way is bloody, sexual and self-reflective, musing of his own demons, as he tries to vanquish those he encounters.", "popularity": "5.467355", "poster_path": "/4kggRn855GvcVm6sl17zDYD3jqA.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Producciones Panicas", "id": 11656}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "MX", "name": "Mexico"}], "release_date": "1970-12-18", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 125, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.4", "vote_count": "109"}
