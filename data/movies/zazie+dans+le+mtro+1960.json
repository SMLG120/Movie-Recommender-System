Based on a popular novel by Raymond Queneau that had been considered unadaptable, Malle\u2019s audacious Zazie dans le m\u00e9tro, made with flair on the cusp of the French New Wave, is a bit of stream-of-consciousness slapstick, wall-to-wall with visual gags, editing tricks, and effects.", "popularity": "3.297004", "poster_path": "/7mlqkmLAPQq5cu6FknL7GPJpnGy.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Nouvelles \u00c9ditions de Films (NEF)", "id": 753}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1960-10-28", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 89, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.6", "vote_count": "29"}
