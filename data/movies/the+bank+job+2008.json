Martine is a beautiful model from Terry's old neighbourhood who knows that Terry is no angel. When Martine proposes a foolproof plan to rob a bank, Terry recognises the danger but realises this may be the opportunity of a lifetime. As the resourceful band of thieves burrows its way into a safe-deposit vault at a Lloyds Bank, they quickly realise that, besides millions in riches, the boxes also contain secrets that implicate everyone from London's most notorious underworld gangsters to powerful government figures, and even the Royal Family. Although the heist makes headlines throughout Britain for several days, a government gag order eventually brings all reporting of the case to an immediate halt.", "popularity": "8.732701", "poster_path": "/zS3mDKTGRTQtnfiIRPnjHZM9r0l.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Atlas Entertainment", "id": 507}, {"name": "Mosaic Media Group", "id": 748}, {"name": "Omnilab Media", "id": 2729}, {"name": "Relativity Media", "id": 7295}, {"name": "Skyline (Baker St)", "id": 37774}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "AU", "name": "Australia"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2008-02-28", "revenue": "64822796", "runtime": 112, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.6", "vote_count": "708"}
