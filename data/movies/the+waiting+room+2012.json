The film - using a blend of cinema verit\u00e9 and characters' voice over - offers a raw, intimate, and even uplifting look at how patients, executive staff and caregivers each cope with disease, bureaucracy and hard choices. It is a film about fighting for survival when the odds are stacked against you.", "popularity": "1.198442", "poster_path": "/dJIHhLVPaSJohwytzfMx90Baw77.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2012-09-26", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 0, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.2", "vote_count": "9"}
