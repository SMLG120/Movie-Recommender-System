His crusade gains momentum and he is soon surrounded by an odd assortment of characters: Cy Sedgewick, an American TV commentator who becomes impressed and rallies world-wide support; a U.S. photographer, Abe Fields, who is sent to do a picture story on Morel and stays on to follow his ideals; Saint Denis, a government aide ordered to stop Morel; Orsini, a professional ivory hunter whose vested interests aren't the same as Morel's; and Waitari, leader of a Pan-African movement who follows Morel only for the personal good it will do his own campaign.", "popularity": "0.522564", "poster_path": "/nUXNIuipZowZdff7MeI5KBwxtLN.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation", "id": 306}, {"name": "Darryl F.
