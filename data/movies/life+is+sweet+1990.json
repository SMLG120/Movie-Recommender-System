Wendy clerks in a shop, leads aerobics at a primary school, jokes like a vaudevillian, agrees to waitress at a friend's new restaurant and dotes on Andy, a cook who forever puts off home remodeling projects, and with a drunken friend, buys a broken down lunch wagon. Natalie, with short neat hair and a snappy, droll manner, is a plumber; she has a holiday planned in America, but little else. Last is Nicola, odd man out: a snarl, big glasses, cigarette, mussed hair, jittery fingers, bulimic, jobless, and unhappy. How they interact and play out family conflict and love is the film's subject.", "popularity": "5.82664", "poster_path": "/p6zgpGIz5PhslLm09FzzDKFshOg.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Film Four International", "id": 9210}, {"name": "Thin Man Films", "id": 10100}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "1990-11-15", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 103, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.9", "vote_count": "46"}
