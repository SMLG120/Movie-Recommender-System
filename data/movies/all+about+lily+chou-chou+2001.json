He was skilled at kendo, and had an attractive young mother. Yuichi, on the other hand, was a quieter boy who fell in love with the music of the odd musician Lily Chou-Chou. During a group trip to Okinawa, Hoshino had a traumatic near-death experience and his personality changed from good-natured to dangerous and manipulative. In high school, he takes his place as class bully and shows his newfound power by ruining the lives of his classmates.", "popularity": "2.695993", "poster_path": "/5xTd0LmJMhlembruYRKuCaFaIZv.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Rockwell Eyes", "id": 2487}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "JP", "name": "Japan"}], "release_date": "2001-09-07", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 146, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.6", "vote_count": "39"}
