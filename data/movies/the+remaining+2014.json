The first of a series of religious-slanted horror movies aimed at devout audiences, THE REMAINING is a surprisingly effective disaster shocker based on the Book of Revelations, produced by the makers of DONNIE DARKO and URBAN LEGEND. When a group of close-knit friends assemble for the marriage of Skylar and Dan, they have no idea they will witness The Rapture and face a series of catastrophic events turning the celebration into a life-or-death struggle. Scrambling for sanctuary and self-preservation while an army of nocturnal creatures they never knew existed unleashes epic destruction, they must understand what is happening around them, and why, to find a way to survive together in a new world order. Witness the birth of a new genre: horror containing spiritually rich content with faith-based appeal.", "popularity": "14.788837", "poster_path": "/61ViFj4qhCWr5tqW53HUSSKLxFD.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Affirm Films", "id": 10156}, {"name": "Sunrise Pictures", "id": 24007}, {"name": "Cinematic", "id": 49204}, {"name": "Baron Films", "id": 49206}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2014-08-25", "revenue": "1169603", "runtime": 88, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "4.1", "vote_count": "91"}
