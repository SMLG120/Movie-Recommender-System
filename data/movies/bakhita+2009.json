She is treated as an outcast by the peasants and the other servants due to her black skin and African background, but Bakhita is kind and generous to others. Bakhita gradually comes closer to God with the help of the kind village priest, and embraces the Catholic faith.  She requests to join the order of Canossian sisters, but Marin doesn't want to give her up as his servant, treating her almost as his property. This leads to a moving court case that raised an uproar which impacts Bakhita's freedom and ultimate decision to become a nun. Pope John Paul II declared her a saint in the year 2000.", "popularity": "1.282949", "poster_path": "/x4uz3mGQwDTIEcfBxQR5li4FedT.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Rai Fiction", "id": 7197}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}], "release_date": "2009-04-04", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 0, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "it", "name": "Italiano"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.0", "vote_count": "4"}
