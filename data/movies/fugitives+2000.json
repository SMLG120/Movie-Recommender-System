Right before they commit the crime, Juanjo informs Tony that his prostitute sister wants him to take her young daughter Laura (Beatriz Coronel) to visit the girl's father, a flamenco singer in the Spanish southern coastal town of Tarifa. Juanjo persuades the initially reluctant Tony that Laura will provide the couple with a perfect cover after they relieve their partners of the robbery's earnings. Unfortunately, though the robbery comes off without a hitch, the duplicitous Juanjo absconds with the cash, making Tony and Laura fugitives both from the law and from the psychotically angry Maxi and Moco.", "popularity": "0.127155", "poster_path": "/s6ElCFrmHWfBZMtiXaH6vWIC5zo.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2000-10-06", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 0, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "0.0", "vote_count": "0"}
