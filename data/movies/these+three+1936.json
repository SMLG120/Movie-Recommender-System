Karen, however, has inherited a farmhouse from her grandmother, and gets the idea that she and Martha can turn it into a school for girls. They travel to the farmhouse, which turns out to be quite rundown, and all hope seems lost, until they meet Dr. Joe Cardin, who tells them not to give up, to take out a loan, fix up the farmhouse, and it will work out. All seems to go according to plan, until one student devises a scheme for revenge for being punished by the teachers. Unlike Lillian Hellman's \"The Children's Hour\", this film has a mostly happy ending and leaves out all references to lesbianism, making it a love triangle instead of a love chain.", "popularity": "1.513527", "poster_path": "/11YUgtvxXpVv9NjXNrtgom8QLDH.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Samuel Goldwyn Company, The", "id": 28205}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1936-03-18", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 93, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.2", "vote_count": "12"}
