The husband chafes at the confinement of high society, though, and yearns for a creative outlet. He decides to write a play and collaborates with a fellow reporter (Loretta Young); the results are unexpectedly hilarious, especially when Young shows up at the mansion with a gaggle of boozehound reporters in tow. With snappy, ribald dialogue (allowable in those pre-Hays Code days), Capra keeps the gags flying fast and furious, taking special delight in having Williams's journalist pals rib him endlessly over his kept-man status. Platinum Blonde was a great success at the time of its release during the class-conscious Depression; for better or worse, its star Harlow was identified with the tag \"platinum blonde\" until her untimely death. --Jerry Renshaw", "popularity": "1.974577", "poster_path": "/19VBUTCGYcDyQa7FUv42VoBmLpm.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Columbia Pictures Corporation", "id": 441}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1931-10-31", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.0", "vote_count": "7"}
