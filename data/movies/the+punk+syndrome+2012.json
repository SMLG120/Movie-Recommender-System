The band members, Pertti, Kari, Toni and Sami, are mentally handicapped and they play their music with a lot of attitude and pride. We follow these professional musicians on their journey from obscurity to popularity. We watch them fight, fall in love and experience strong emotions. We witness long days in the recording studio and on tour. They laugh, cry, drink and fight over who gets to sit in the front on the tour bus. Then it\u2019s time to make up and go talk to people in the audience and tell them how great their band is.", "popularity": "0.332434", "poster_path": "/h8GNFBKIyuuDrYGseREeHkPrQAC.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Mouka Filmi Oy", "id": 10195}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FI", "name": "Finland"}, {"iso_3166_1": "NO", "name": "Norway"}, {"iso_3166_1": "SE", "name": "Sweden"}], "release_date": "2012-05-04", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 85, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fi", "name": "suomi"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.6", "vote_count": "7"}
