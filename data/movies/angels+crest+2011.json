Ethan, one of the town's residents, is a young father but not much more than a kid himself. He has no choice but to look after his three-year-old son Nate, since mom Cindy is an alcoholic. But one snowy day, Ethan's good intentions are thwarted by a moment of thoughtlessness, resulting in tragedy. A local prosecutor haunted by his past goes after Ethan, and the ensuing confusion and casting of blame begins to tear the town apart.", "popularity": "6.123723", "poster_path": "/qpSXab96gQ1u69BVQO6dxsIaTt9.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Process Film", "id": 8096}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2011-12-30", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 92, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.9", "vote_count": "20"}
