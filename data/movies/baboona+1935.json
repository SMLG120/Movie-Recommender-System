As usual, staged scenes of danger and peril, such as landing their plane on an unexplored lake filled with crocodiles, which didn't seem to bother whoever was on the unexplored shore shooting the landing. Lots of wild animal and African native-tribes footage included.", "popularity": "0.001247", "poster_path": "/oDAjhFyytc4ttz2l34ZXtOibFv3.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1935-01-19", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 0, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "0.0", "vote_count": "0"}
