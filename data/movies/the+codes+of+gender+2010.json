Jhally's starting point is the breakthrough work of the late sociologist Erving Goffman, whose 1959 book The Presentation of the Self in Everyday Life prefigured the growing field of performance studies. Jhally applies Goffman's analysis of the body in print advertising to hundreds of print ads today, uncovering an astonishing pattern of regressive and destructive gender codes. By looking beyond advertising as a medium that simply sells products, and beyond analyses of gender that tend to focus on either biology or objectification, The Codes of Gender offers important insights into the social construction of masculinity and femininity, the relationship between gender and power, and the everyday performance of cultural norms.", "popularity": "0.215909", "poster_path": "/kyJDDx87MQrWRpShw4ATaBppLUm.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Media Education Foundation", "id": 27072}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2010-10-13", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 73, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.1", "vote_count": "4"}
