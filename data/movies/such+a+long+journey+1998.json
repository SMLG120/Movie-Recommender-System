We meet the hero, Gustad (Roshan Seth), in the process of defending the old concrete wall that protects his courtyard from the street, and later he strikes a bargain with an itinerant artist (Ranjit Chowdhry), who covers the wall with paintings from every conceivable religious tradition, with the thought that all of the groups represented will join in defending the wall.", "popularity": "0.001207", "poster_path": "/u46Y01D43PsJrrAplpQ65P9MMi0.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1998-09-13", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 113, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "0.0", "vote_count": "0"}
