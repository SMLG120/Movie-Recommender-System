Armed with a phalanx of hidden cameras, black-market diplomatic credentials and a bleeding-edge wit, Br\u00fcgger transforms himself into an outlandish caricature of a European-African consul. As he immerses himself in the life-threatening underworld of nefarious bureaucrats, Br\u00fcgger encounters blood diamond smuggling, bribery, and even murder -- while somehow managing to crack amazing razor-sharp barbs at every step along the way. From each absurdly terrifying/hilarious situation to the next, The Ambassador is a one-of-a-kind excursion from the man whom The Huffington Post has called \u201cthe most provocative filmmaker in the world.\u201d", "popularity": "0.684441", "poster_path": "/cgxu7aVRwQ3e1IlrKQOQEi1jeMT.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Drafthouse Films", "id": 10485}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DK", "name": "Denmark"}], "release_date": "2011-10-05", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 93, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "da", "name": "Dansk"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "sg", "name": ""}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.8", "vote_count": "15"}
