She flashes back and remembers her coming-of-age. Her recollections are sometimes less than sweet, particularly those of her troubled and alcoholic step-father. Her memories of Robin, her first-love, are much happier and she also recalls her colorful Aunt Starr -- who's visit is fun but also detrimental to her family's health. The setting of 1950s Las Vegas' bomb testing is increasingly significant to the development of the story.", "popularity": "1.229428", "poster_path": "/dpt2v32ZBe6QYd9UaHyph1HFhXe.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1986-01-22", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 105, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "4.9", "vote_count": "8"}
