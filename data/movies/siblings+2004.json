First off, their stepparents are despicably evil. Secondly, they seemed to have killed them. Now this mixed up mess of half-sisters and step-brothers have to figure out how to dispose of the bodies, cover up the murders, collect their grandfather's inheritance and somehow stick together as a family -- all without getting caught. Not to mention Joe's incessant need to keep tabs on his promiscuous sister, an eye on the precocious little ones and a lustful watch on the girl next-door. Growing up has its complications. Murder's just one of them.", "popularity": "1.435388", "poster_path": "/yUAH62tziURf4pBAaBsbluKSUzc.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Canadian Film Centre (CFC)", "id": 14185}, {"name": "Step-Films Inc.", "id": 64572}, {"name": "Feature Film Project, The", "id": 64574}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}], "release_date": "2004-09-14", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 85, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.8", "vote_count": "5"}
