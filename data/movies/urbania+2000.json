His encounters are planned and chance: with a homeless man who sleeps by his building, with a friend who's dying, with the couple who lives (and noisily loves) in the flat above him, with a bartender and a one-night-stand he follows home, and with a tattooed stranger whom he seeks out and befriends. Along the way, Charlie inhabits a city full of moments of violence and of stories and legends: a kidney thief, a microwaved poodle, a rat in a hot dog bun, a baby left on a car top, a tourist's toothbrush, needles in public-phone change slots. Charlie lives and tells his own stories. What caused his melancholy?", "popularity": "0.445233", "poster_path": "/qL2vKjQKgTzGUGXcsyBftUiwpLw.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2000-01-24", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 103, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.2", "vote_count": "10"}
