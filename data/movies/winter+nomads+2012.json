In the month of November 2010, they embark on their long winter transhumance: four months during which they will have to cover 600 km in the Swiss- French region, accompanied by three donkeys, four dogs and a eight hundred sheep. An exceptional adventure is about to begin: they brave the cold and the bad weather day in day out, with a canvas cover and animal skins as their only shelter at night. This saga reveals a tough and exacting profession, requiring constant improvisation and unflinching attention to nature, the animals and the cosmos. An eventful journey with surprise encounters, moving reunions with farmer friends, nostalgic figures of country life that is shrinking away fast. \u0391n adventure film, a contemporary road movie, a reflection of our current world, which takes us back to our roots and our inner questions.", "popularity": "0.199527", "poster_path": "/6kvZmCiPRB5uFKTDK4my8tVc09v.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "KMBO", "id": 6841}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CH", "name": "Switzerland"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}], "release_date": "2012-02-10", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "8.0", "vote_count": "3"}
