Fearing that this will inevitably result in rape and pillage, the mayor \u2014 supported by his town council \u2014 has the idea of pretending to be newly dead, in order to avoid receiving the soldiers. But his redoubtable wife Cornelia despises this strategem and organises the other women to prepare hospitality and to adapt their carnival entertainments for the Spaniards (who insist on entering the town anyway).", "popularity": "0.550797", "poster_path": "/ss5L30KqTDZtaRJ8P8vV3OaStWZ.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1935-12-03", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 110, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.2", "vote_count": "6"}
