This very well made movie pieces together testimonies and evidence and investigates Pynchon's background and (speculative) motivations, not just for his persistent hiding, but especially for his writing. It left me with a lot of admiration for the person Thomas Pynchon, who is happy to have his books read and get on with his life, rather than cheapen himself on the media circuit. The sound track is aptly provided by \"The Residents\", an American underground band who for the past 30 years have only appeared masked on stage and whose members are unknown. Seems that Pynchon is in good company.", "popularity": "0.002844", "poster_path": "/6aqHZkQetgowxJ5QhmFKpfKIzdk.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2003-05-02", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 96, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "0.0", "vote_count": "0"}
