An assassin, a religious zealot, a mother, and a thief...just moments after being confined, it becomes clear that one of them is mortally wounded. As the minutes tick by, a battle for survival ensues where each of them is forced to examine their sordid ties to St. Julian-the building, as well as the legacy of the religious figure.", "popularity": "0.041232", "poster_path": "/k7KmmkyzmmCgt204fAAJsADzFyv.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2010-08-24", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 86, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "8.0", "vote_count": "1"}
