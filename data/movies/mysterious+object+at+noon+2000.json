The film crew set out on an expedition across Thailand, from the north to the south, documenting several lives along the way. In the process, each subject filmed is required to continue a story. A next person in another city is asked to resume the story with total freedom of expression. The person can even come back to any point in the story, make changes, and continue the tale alternatively. The film emphasises a documentary approach that presents people with different professions rather than looking for a perfect and unbroken narrative of the fiction's storyline. After the journey from the south, the crew set back for Bangkok, where the collaborated story is shot in a fiction-drama style with non-professional actors.", "popularity": "0.404131", "poster_path": "/pVq8GT23E0kv6MUNf5IGMtbcrNT.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Firecracker Films", "id": 12709}, {"name": "9/6 Cinema Factory", "id": 75132}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "TH", "name": "Thailand"}, {"iso_3166_1": "NL", "name": "Netherlands"}], "release_date": "2000-11-08", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 83, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "th", "name": "\u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.1", "vote_count": "7"}
