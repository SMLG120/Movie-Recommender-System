Estranged from her husband, she's with her children only every other weekend. It's her weekend, but her agent has booked her to MC a Rotary club dinner in Vichy. She takes them with her, and when her husband learns this, he demands to pick them up at once. She bolts in a rented car to the seaside, trying to improve her relations with the children, especially the precocious and distant Vincent. He loves astronomy. A rare meteor shower is due in a few days, so she suggests they go to a plateau in Spain hoping to see it. He agrees, but the relationship remains difficult, and her husband is on their trail.", "popularity": "0.629807", "poster_path": "/oCNfIlM8cbj2oMlBzSRUGx8TF8.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "MK2 Production", "id": 6274}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1990-08-28", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 104, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.0", "vote_count": "2"}
