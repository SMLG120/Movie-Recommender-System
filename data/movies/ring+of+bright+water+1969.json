Mij is a cute, cuddly pet shop otter who captures the heart of Graham Merill (Bill Travers). It doesn't take Graham long to realize that London is no place to raise a slippery otter. So he takes Mij to live in a ramshackle cottage on the coast of Scotland. Together they set out to explore the curious and magnificent natural wonders that surround their seaside home--from orphaned geese to tooth-less sharks. While Mij spends his days frolicking in the icy cold sea, Graham finds himself falling in love with the beautiful town doctor, Mary (Virginia McKenna). Before long, the three become inseparable friends.", "popularity": "0.508126", "poster_path": "/4977B8LxMmzh5x2PJplRoREOw2M.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "The Rank Organisation", "id": 364}, {"name": "Palomar Pictures International", "id": 12146}, {"name": "Brightwater Film Production", "id": 40021}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "1969-06-18", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 107, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "gd", "name": ""}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "3.2", "vote_count": "6"}
