Greenaway explains the background, the context, the conspiracy, the murder and the motives of all its 34 painted characters who have conspired to kill for their combined self-advantage. Greenaway leads us through Rembrandt's paintings into 17th century Amsterdam. He paints a world that is democratic in principle, but is almost entirely ruled by twelve families. The notion exists of these regents as charitable and compassionate beings. However, reality was different.", "popularity": "0.58526", "poster_path": "/1Y0misvBsGzpbd5r58YHYRRQvzI.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Arte", "id": 201}, {"name": "Yleisradio (YLE)", "id": 5975}, {"name": "Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR)", "id": 7025}, {"name": "Vrijzinnig Protestantse Radio Omroep (VPRO)", "id": 8659}, {"name": "Submarine", "id": 55968}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FI", "name": "Finland"}, {"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "NL", "name": "Netherlands"}], "release_date": "2008-10-04", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 86, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "8.5", "vote_count": "4"}
