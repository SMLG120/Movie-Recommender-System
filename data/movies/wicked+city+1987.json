A peace treaty between the Earth and the Black World, a parallel universe of spider-like aliens is coming to an end. Two cops, Taki, a human male, and Maki, a female alien, are assigned to protect a diplomat who will help secure another treaty. A radical group of aliens from the Black World are out to assassinate the diplomat and prevent the treaty; only the bond that forms between the two cops can save the Earth from destruction. Sex is strongly associated with violence in many graphic scenes; although this is intended to play a symbolic role, this theme is used excessively. The story is effective, but the film is definitely not for children or anyone easily offended.", "popularity": "2.684329", "poster_path": "/5T6jsn5m7NyDJq61RvDwVIbWeio.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Manga", "id": 3706}, {"name": "Madhouse", "id": 4288}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "JP", "name": "Japan"}], "release_date": "1987-04-19", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 82, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.1", "vote_count": "31"}
