Reese joins a group of weary GIs unexpectedly ordered back into the line when on their way to a rest area. While most of the men withdraw from their positions facing a German pillbox at the far side of a mine-field, half a dozen men are left to protect a wide front. By various ruses, they manage to convince the Germans that a large force is still holding the position. Then Reese leads two of the men in an unauthorized and unsuccessful attack on the pillbox, in which the other two are killed; and when the main platoon returns, he is threatened with court-martial. Rather that face the disgrace, and in an attempt to show he was right, he makes a one-man attack on the pillbox.", "popularity": "3.062515", "poster_path": "/5P8qQm2Wi8NJVweWWZheqykAe7k.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Paramount Pictures", "id": 4}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1962-06-26", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "pl", "name": "Polski"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.5", "vote_count": "34"}
