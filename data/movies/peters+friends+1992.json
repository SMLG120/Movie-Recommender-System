Ten years ago, they all acted together in a Cambridge University student comedy troupe, but it's less clear how much they have in common now.Peter's friends are Andrew (Branagh), now a writer in Hollywood; married jingle writers Roger (Laurie) and Mary (Staunton); glamorous costume designer Sarah (Emmanuel); and eccentric Maggie (Thompson), who works in publishing. Cast in sharp relief to the university chums are Carol (Rudner), the American TV star wife of Andrew; and loutish Brian (Slattery), Sarah's very recently acquired lover. Law plays Peter's disapproving housekeeper, Vera; and Lowe, her son Paul. Briers appears in a cameo role as Peter's father.", "popularity": "2.540085", "poster_path": "/rmtLaQCQihbKIsuriek8qbjWbSu.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Channel Four Films", "id": 181}, {"name": "Renaissance Films", "id": 3102}, {"name": "British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)", "id": 3324}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "1992-09-18", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 101, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "hu", "name": "Magyar"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.7", "vote_count": "46"}
