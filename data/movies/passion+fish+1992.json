She returns to her old home in Louisiana, where she proceeds to drink quite steadily and to drive away five personal attendants in the first twenty minutes of the movie. Then she meets with Chantelle, whose stubbornness matches her own -- if only because Chantelle, herself a recovering cocaine addict, cannot afford to lose this job. Their mutual dislike gradually develops into an armed truce as the two women deal with their own problems and with each others'.", "popularity": "5.367604", "poster_path": "/xiDasTZfOZ0jEZ6O3NiapeVzUIV.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Atchafalaya", "id": 36289}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1992-12-11", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 135, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.7", "vote_count": "7"}
