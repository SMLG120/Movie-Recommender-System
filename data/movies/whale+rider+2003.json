From then on, Whangara chiefs, always the first-born, always male, have been considered Paikea's direct descendants. Pai, an 11-year-old girl in a patriarchal New Zealand tribe, believes she is destined to be the new chief. But her grandfather Koro is bound by tradition to pick a male leader. Pai loves Koro more than anyone in the world, but she must fight him and a thousand years of tradition to fulfill her destiny.", "popularity": "11.040186", "poster_path": "/x6qMQ6LActtQSjuXidzuhqVW3AT.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "South Pacific Pictures", "id": 654}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "NZ", "name": "New Zealand"}], "release_date": "2003-01-30", "revenue": "41400000", "runtime": 101, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "mi", "name": ""}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.1", "vote_count": "114"}
