Of American Indian ancestry, but adopted by white foster parents as young children, each sister has her own identity issues and each has chosen a very different career path. Now dedicated to starting a Native cosmetic business, they attempt to overcome obstacles both in the business world and in the home. A touching love story of family and culture, Naturally Native also interweaves a subtle, but strong wake-up call regarding the treatment of Native people in corporate America. Naturally Native also provides some insight into tribal infrastructure and gaming issues.", "popularity": "0.101618", "poster_path": "/esEkysmPlqZw4vtwZ4wWQ7o2EIy.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Red-horse Native", "id": 38147}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1999-10-08", "revenue": "10508", "runtime": 107, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "0.0", "vote_count": "0"}
