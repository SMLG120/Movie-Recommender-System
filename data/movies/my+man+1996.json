One night, a homeless man sleeps in the foyer of her apartment house; she gives him a hot meal, then a place on the floor to sleep by her radiator, then she offers herself. She falls in love, giving him new life, clothes, a place to live. When he grouses that he must bar hop while she uses the flat for her work, she finds them a larger flat. He grows restless, seducing a manicurist and pressing her to prostitution. He's arrested for procuring, so Marie must decide what to do; he, too, must face the consequences of his choices.", "popularity": "1.25783", "poster_path": "/p2d6PCB9QHOs4IBMQb8JIENT18O.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Les Films Alain Sarde", "id": 635}, {"name": "Plateau A", "id": 1852}, {"name": "Canal+", "id": 5358}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1996-01-31", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 99, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.6", "vote_count": "4"}
