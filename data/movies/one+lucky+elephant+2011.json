Sixteen years have passed since circus producer David Balding adopted Flora, the orphaned baby African elephant he lovingly raised as part of his family and made the star of his show. As Flora approaches adulthood, he realizes that she is not happy performing. Ultimately, David must face the difficult truth that the circus is no place for Flora. She needs to be with other elephants. The road to Flora\u2019s retirement, however, is a difficult and emotional journey which tests their bond in unexpected ways. Ten years in the making, One Lucky Elephant explores the consequences of keeping wild animals in captivity, while never losing sight of the delicate love story at its heart.", "popularity": "0.044894", "poster_path": "/vMkMnFvx03xzkDmn50TyNlXrC85.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2011-06-08", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 84, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "8.0", "vote_count": "1"}
