Collectively the Franks and Pekka are unhappy with the perceived oppression they face in their district of Helsinki, Kallio, and decide to move to another, Eira, imagining it to be an unspoiled place where people can live lives of dignity. The journey is an ironic one given that both districts are not so far apart. In this spirit, their journey across the city takes on epic proportions with each of the travellers gradually falling by the wayside due to such travails as marriage, work, and death. In its entirety the film is a wry discussion of humanity within a system that regards humans as subservient components.", "popularity": "1.01438", "poster_path": "/a1X1jOFVlKy27WOV70r2OiY4hgg.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Villealfa Filmproduction Oy", "id": 2303}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FI", "name": "Finland"}], "release_date": "1985-02-08", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 84, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "fi", "name": "suomi"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.8", "vote_count": "18"}
