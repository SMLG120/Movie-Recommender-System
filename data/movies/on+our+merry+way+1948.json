Martha suggests, \"Has a little child ever changed your life?\" Oliver gets answers from two slow-talking musicians, an actress whose roles usually feature a sarong, and an itinerant cardsharp. In each case the \"little child\" is hardly innocent: in the first, a local auto mechanic's \"baby\" turns out to be fully developed as a woman and a musician; in the second, a spoiled child star learns kindness; in the third, the family of a lost brat doesn't want him returned. And Oliver, what becomes of him?", "popularity": "0.608104", "poster_path": "/l6RXx49Z7di3w1qn235ik0UUVU4.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "United Artists", "id": 60}, {"name": "Benedict Bogeaus Production", "id": 5426}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1948-02-03", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 107, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.0", "vote_count": "1"}
