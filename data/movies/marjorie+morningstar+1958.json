Like Marjorie, he is an upper-middle-class New York Jew (born 'Ehrman'), but has fallen away from his roots, and Marjorie's parents object among other things to his lack of a suitable profession, such as medicine or law. Noel himself warns Marjorie repeatedly that she's much too naive and conventional for him, but they nonetheless fall in love. As they pursue an on-again-off-again relationship, Marjorie completes her studies at Hunter College, and works to establish an acting career, while Noel first leaves the theater for a job with an advertising agency, but later completes a musical he'd started writing before he and Marjorie had first met.", "popularity": "0.728406", "poster_path": "/uZN11NcxILCdLw9Ih6ryP1bfVJR.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Warner Bros.", "id": 6194}, {"name": "Beachwold Productions", "id": 17271}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1958-04-24", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 128, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.5", "vote_count": "5"}
