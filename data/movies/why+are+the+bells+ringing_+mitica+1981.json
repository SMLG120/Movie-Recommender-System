Pintilie creates a strange combination of carnival scenes which is brought to the screen as a burlesque, fast-paced, screwball comedy with a meditative undertone. This film was banned in Romania for a decade until the death of Ceausescu in 1989 and was only released after the 1989 revolution.", "popularity": "0.273568", "poster_path": "/zyrhyvnSjHi9QrBalPQqcEFWNkP.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Casa de Filme Unu", "id": 43849}, {"name": "Casa de Filme Cinci", "id": 93666}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "RO", "name": "Romania"}], "release_date": "1981-09-26", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 132, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ro", "name": "Rom\u00e2n\u0103"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.0", "vote_count": "1"}
