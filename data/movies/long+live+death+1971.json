His mother is religious, sympathetic to the Fascists; his father is accused of being a Red. Fando discovers that his mother may have aided in his father's arrest. Sometimes we witness Fando imagining explanations for what's going on; sometimes we see him at play, alone or with his friend Th\u00e9r\u00e8se. Oedipal fantasies and a lad's natural curiosity about sex and death mix with his search for his mother's nature and his father's fate. Will Fando survive the search?", "popularity": "0.008527", "poster_path": "/zfbfR61gSrt43mLMNPU74UuV3bz.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Isabelle Films", "id": 7001}, {"name": "SATPEC", "id": 49800}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "TN", "name": "Tunisia"}], "release_date": "1971-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.1", "vote_count": "8"}
