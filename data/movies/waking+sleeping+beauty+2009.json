The artists were polarized between newcomers hungry to innovate and old timers not yet ready to relinquish control. These conditions produced a series of box-office flops and pessimistic forecasts: maybe the best days of animation were over. Maybe the public didn't care. Only a miracle or a magic spell could produce a happy ending. Waking Sleeping Beauty is no fairy tale. It's the true story of how Disney regained its magic with a staggering output of hits - \"Little Mermaid,\" \"Beauty and the Beast ,\" \"Aladdin,\" \"The Lion King,\" and more - over a 10-year period.", "popularity": "0.908184", "poster_path": "/4sUM0oSUKDVIkQAgV85g0Ap6zdj.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures", "id": 3036}, {"name": "Red Shoes / Some Shoes", "id": 16635}, {"name": "Stone Circle Pictures", "id": 90506}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2009-09-05", "revenue": "80", "runtime": 86, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.4", "vote_count": "22"}
