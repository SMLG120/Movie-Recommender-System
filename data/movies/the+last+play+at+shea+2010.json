Shea Stadium was closed (in part to create more parking space for a new stadium, Citi Field), and on July 16 and 18, 2008, Billy Joel headlined the final concerts held at the stadium. Filmmaker Paul Crowder and a camera crew were on hand for Joel's shows, and the documentary THE LAST PLAY AT SHEA chronicles his historic two-night stand, as well as exploring Joel's career, his ties to working-class New York, and how his life and career paralleled the growth of suburban Long Island and the beloved ballpark.", "popularity": "0.216136", "poster_path": "/jXML1KnswYnSHTs7w4XNFc3GCPD.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2010-04-25", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "4.7", "vote_count": "3"}
