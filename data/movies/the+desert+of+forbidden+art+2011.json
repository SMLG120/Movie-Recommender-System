During the Soviet rule artists who stay true to their vision are executed, sent to mental hospitals or Gulags.  Their plight inspires young Igor Savitsky. He pretends to buy state-approved art but instead daringly rescues 40,000 forbidden fellow artist's works and creates a museum in the desert of Uzbekistan, far from the watchful eyes of the KGB. Though a penniless artist himself, he cajoles the cash to pay for the art from the same authorities who are banning it. Savitsky amasses an eclectic mix of Russian Avant-Garde art. But his greatest discovery is an unknown school of artists who settle in Uzbekistan after the Russian revolution of 1917, encountering a unique Islamic culture, as exotic to them as Tahiti was for Gauguin. They develop a startlingly original style, fusing European modernism with centuries-old Eastern traditions.", "popularity": "0.093639", "poster_path": "/qbnDE8UVhP4bWYpR8CbrI0GTHB5.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2011-03-18", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 80, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.0", "vote_count": "1"}
