While Marcel has become famous and Pierre has not, both are happy with their lives. Pierre is happily married to Romaine, a stylish young flapper. However, Marcel meets and falls in love with her, which Marcel little suspects. Romaine carries on her affair with Marcel, even as Pierre falls ill, which she may have deliberately exacerbated with her treatment in order to murder him. Soon Marcel goes on a concert tour, and Romaine abandons Pierre for a romantic tryst. When Marcel returns, Romaine reconsiders the affair, and realizes that she loves both Pierre and Marcel. She decides that she does not want to hurt either her husband or her lover, and as no other solution seems possible, she commits suicide. Three years later, Pierre visits Marcel to seek the truth, and Marcel tells him that no illicit affair occurred, thereby honoring her memory.", "popularity": "0.767496", "poster_path": "/2fdP3qy5Qgc6hFa3KUt0v9JKcnw.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Films A2", "id": 875}, {"name": "MK2 Productions", "id": 9209}, {"name": "Centre National de la Cin\u00e9matographie (CNC)", "id": 18367}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1986-09-03", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 112, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.8", "vote_count": "4"}
