Max von Sydow stars as Dr. Vogler, a nineteenth-century traveling mesmerist and peddler of potions whose magic is put to the test in Stockholm by the cruel, eminently rational royal medical adviser Dr. Verg\u00e9rus. The result is a diabolically clever battle of wits that\u2019s both frightening and funny, shot in rich, gorgeously gothic black and white.", "popularity": "7.606709", "poster_path": "/rmdPJfwTUUjNW5FhuTxYkSKMfaO.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Svensk Filmindustri (SF)", "id": 6181}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "SE", "name": "Sweden"}], "release_date": "1958-12-26", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 101, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "sv", "name": "svenska"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.4", "vote_count": "44"}
