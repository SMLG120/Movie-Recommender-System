Brokering the incident for political capital, Shaw eventually becomes a vice-presidential nominee, while Marco is haunted by dreams of what happened -- or didn't happen -- in Kuwait. As Marco (now a Major) investigates, the story begins to unravel, to the point where he questions if it happened at all. Is it possible the entire unit was kidnapped and brainwashed to believe Shaw is a war hero as part of a plot to seize the White House? Some very powerful people at Manchurian Global corporation appear desperate to stop him from finding out.", "popularity": "10.796939", "poster_path": "/7gZZ6Qk2TZf4bEXHYbBEFlH8emJ.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Paramount Pictures", "id": 4}, {"name": "Scott Rudin Productions", "id": 258}, {"name": "Clinica Estetico", "id": 1274}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2004-07-30", "revenue": "96105964", "runtime": 129, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.2", "vote_count": "401"}
