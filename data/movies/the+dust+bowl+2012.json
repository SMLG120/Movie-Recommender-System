Menacing black blizzards killed farmers\u2019 crops and livestock, threatened the lives of their children, and forced thousands of desperate families to pick up and move somewhere else. Vivid interviews with more than two dozen survivors of those hard times, combined with dramatic photographs and seldom seen movie footage, bring to life stories of incredible human suffering and equally incredible human perseverance.  The Dust Bowl, a four-hour, two-episode documentary from acclaimed filmmaker Ken Burns, is also a morality tale about our relationship to the land that sustains us\u2014a lesson we ignore at our peril.", "popularity": "0.434151", "poster_path": "/jPhkOTVXUb6zscHcvI2F0UZKGiR.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2012-11-17", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 240, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.5", "vote_count": "2"}
