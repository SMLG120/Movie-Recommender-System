The new album was to be called \"SMiLE\". SMiLE pushed the envelope both musically and lyrically, and was supposed to out-do the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper record. But Brian wasn't able to sell the project to his band-mates when they returned. The project was shelved and Wilson's well-documented decline into depression, drug abuse, recluseness, and obesity had begun. Thirty-odd years later, Wilson announced that in 2004, SMiLE would be performed live in its entirety in London. This film tells the story of a damaged but healing artist bringing his greatest work to light.", "popularity": "0.563247", "poster_path": "/hoTldqJ5ol6bZQ7I0VjHFhdzFcN.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2004-10-05", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 109, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.3", "vote_count": "3"}
