One night, a rich young businessman makes an advance on him during one of his driving jobs. They meet again the next day: it is during a round of redundancy cuts at the factory where Sumin refuses an attempt by a man (who is in fact the boss' son Jaemin) to save his job. Eventually, Sumin is seduced into working as a prostitute in an up-market boy-brothel as Jaemin's obsession with him grows, leaving Jaemin helpless in the face of his overwhelming desire. This is a film of bold sexuality, where unexpected passion, desire and misunderstandings wreak havoc of an operatic intensity.", "popularity": "0.553169", "poster_path": "/1cDBqcsA6dqDbiNYHL0smVpCChX.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Generation Blue Films", "id": 79409}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "KR", "name": "South Korea"}], "release_date": "2006-11-16", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 113, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ko", "name": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4/\uc870\uc120\ub9d0"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.4", "vote_count": "9"}
