Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric is a family man who needs a vacation. Upon arriving at his cottage in the country, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric makes the acquaintance of Hugo -- the gay neighbor who resides in the adjacent cottage. A free spirit who is open about his sexuality and frequently goes skinny-dipping in the moonlight, Hugo seems to be everything that Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric isn't. Soon, the tension between Hugo and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric is palpable. Yet, while they may be at odds over their opposite lifestyles, the two men are also obviously attracted to one another and soon begin to flirt heavily. But Hugo's taunting of hopeless romantic Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric begins bordering on cruel when it becomes obvious that Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric is jealous of his new lover.", "popularity": "1.692026", "poster_path": "/lM0vxlo1l1ZbtX80L98pxhpAodJ.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Pan Europ\u00e9enne Production", "id": 796}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "2006-09-08", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 114, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.6", "vote_count": "9"}
