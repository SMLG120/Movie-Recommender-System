First the monk uses a rod and reel, then a net; over and over, he ends up fish-less and wet. Sleepless, he tries luring the fish at night with a bank of candles. He tries a bow and arrow. The tireless and insouciant fish leads the monk through a viaduct, over irrigated steppes, across cisterns, down canals. Suddenly, the monk's chase and the fish's teasing flight become a spiritual journey.", "popularity": "0.459924", "poster_path": "/u7ZWmVD3ycmPATABoW6SUS7k2l8.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1994-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 6, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.9", "vote_count": "14"}
