Of the twenty million people in Ghana, two million are disabled. This is the story of one disabled man whose mission-and purpose- is to change all that forever. In Emmanuel's Gift, filmmakers Lisa Lax and Nancy Stern have uncovered a story as compelling as it is important. Narrated by Oprah Winfrey, the film chronicles the life of Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah, a young Ghanaian man born with a severely deformed right leg, who today, against incalculable odds, is opening minds, hearts and doors-and effecting social and political change throughout his country.", "popularity": "0.262384", "poster_path": "/kaE415vEFEtC1otWcprkUKf4QGS.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Lookalike Productions LLC", "id": 54949}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2005-10-21", "revenue": "23578", "runtime": 80, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "0.0", "vote_count": "0"}
