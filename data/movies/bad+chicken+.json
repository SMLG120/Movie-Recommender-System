But her dream-come-true quickly turns into a nightmare when she allows a motley television crew of chickens, led by a sociopath, 'Charlie Chicken', to invade her home, manipulate her emotions, and drag her and her soon-to-be-ex-boyfriend into the desert on what is supposed to be a glamorous reality TV shoot. Deep in the surreal landscapes of the Joshua Tree desert, it becomes a battle of species. The hilarious antics of the oddball chicken crew, the blind faith of a reality TV star wannabe, and the cruel perversions of one really 'bad chicken', all spiral downward into an extremely unique Spaghetti Western.", "popularity": "0.007875", "poster_path": "/btxaHWvcUMzX5FeqBNgYzlvwf12.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "null", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "0.0", "vote_count": "0"}
