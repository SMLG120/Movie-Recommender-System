The newcomer gradually earns the trust of the people through humor, but firmly captures their hearts by saving the town fiesta by fighting a bull when the hired torero failed to show.Father Sebasti\u00e1n counsels the townspeople, lecturing them on their duties in a modern society. He used the collection plate to redistribute the town's wealth more evenly. When accused of communism, he quoted the 1891 socially-conscious encyclical Rerum Novarum. He even ventured into politics, with a veiled attack on the municipal president couched into a sermon. Eventually, he brokers a deal with the local political boss for some concessions for the poor of his parish.", "popularity": "1.206366", "poster_path": "/Alt7xYb5mK6rl3Myy1LaHFuzSoy.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Posa Films", "id": 65192}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "MX", "name": "Mexico"}], "release_date": "1964-09-03", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 130, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.3", "vote_count": "4"}
