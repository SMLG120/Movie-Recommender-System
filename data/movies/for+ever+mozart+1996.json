Along their journey they are captured and held in a POW camp, and they call for help from their friends and relations in France. Director Jean-Luc Godard presents stories about this troop to ask how one can make art while slaughters like the one in Bosnia are taking place, and he throws in a strong critique of the European Union. For Ever Mozart is one of Godard's most disjointed and difficult films. Its stories sometimes seem to form a whole and at other times the links among them are unclear. One gets the impression that in each episode Godard attempts to start a film only to come to the conclusion that it is impossible to continue. It features some of the most beautiful shots of tanks in the cinema.", "popularity": "0.413422", "poster_path": "/xTBRaU0tL33TYxfK0cKrzSoMzc6.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Avventura Films", "id": 4491}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CH", "name": "Switzerland"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1996-11-27", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 84, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "8.0", "vote_count": "3"}
