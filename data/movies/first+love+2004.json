Through a classified ad he meets Sonia, a sweet, pleasant, intelligent girl. However, she weighs 125 pounds -- which according to Vittorio is way too much. A goldsmith by trade, Vittorio is obsessed with the desire to shape Sonia's body and mind as does a fire with gold. Almost imperceptibly Sonia becomes a passive participant and the relationship grows into a reciprocal masochistic game. When the two lovers isolate themselves in a country house in the Veneto hills, they dangerously lose touch with reality and the rest of the world.", "popularity": "0.38744", "poster_path": "/eLzgCnAHkEbtbrKH19q8zO4p1fT.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2004-01-01", "revenue": "9392", "runtime": 100, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "it", "name": "Italiano"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.7", "vote_count": "10"}
