Both husband and wife work for the wealthy landlord. The landlord's son, Surya, has to cancel his studies and return home to look after the estate, as well as formalize his marriage to Saroj, the girl he was compelled to get married to when he was very young. Shortly thereafter Kishtaya is apprehended stealing toddy from the fields, is severely beaten, left senseless, and when he recovers he absconds, leaving Laxmi alone to fend for herself. Surya finds her attractive and starts an intimate relationship with her, much to the chagrin of the rest of the family. Things only get worse when Saroj moves in to live with Surya - compelling him to make a final decision about a visibly pregnant Laxmi.", "popularity": "0.078659", "poster_path": "/7uhZK6CSn5XLN4Y7Ons1Yuvo57U.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Blaze Film Enterprises", "id": 80067}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IN", "name": "India"}], "release_date": "1974-07-20", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 125, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "hi", "name": "\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "4.2", "vote_count": "3"}
