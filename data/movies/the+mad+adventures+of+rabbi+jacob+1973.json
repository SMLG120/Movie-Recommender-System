The two dress up as rabbis as they try to elude not only assasins from Slimane's country, but also the police, who think Pivert is a murderer. Pivert ends up posing as Rabbi Jacob, a beloved figure who's returned to France for his first visit after 30 years in the United States. Adding to the confusion are Pivert's dentist-wife, who thinks her husband is leaving her for another woman, their daughter, who's about to get married, and a Parisian neighborhood filled with people eager to celebrate the return of Rabbi Jacob.", "popularity": "7.18207", "poster_path": "/ml5QwbOcDMOaKBOZUZpjg8QsGBh.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Les Films Pomereu", "id": 459}, {"name": "Horse Film", "id": 460}, {"name": "Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nouvelle de Cin\u00e9matographie (SNC)", "id": 16670}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1973-10-17", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 100, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "he", "name": "\u05e2\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea"}, {"iso_639_1": "yi", "name": ""}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.1", "vote_count": "183"}
