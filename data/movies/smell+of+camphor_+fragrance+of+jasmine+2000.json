He's working on a documentary, for Japanese TV, on Iranian burial practices. On the anniversary of his wife's death, a hitchhiker tells him a story of spousal abuse and infant mortality, he discovers that someone has been buried in his plot next to his wife, and he needs the help of his attorney, a well-connected fixer. He dreams of death, even as he investigates it for his film. His niece's husband, a well-known writer, fails to return home; he searches hospitals for an unclaimed body. His heart disease is flaring up. Is he prepared for death? Is that all that's left?", "popularity": "0.036477", "poster_path": "/q2Oruub4itcHD71CBDqmrRppUDK.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Hedayat Film", "id": 23698}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IR", "name": "Iran"}], "release_date": "2000-09-08", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 93, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fa", "name": "\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc"}], "status": "Rumored", "vote_average": "5.0", "vote_count": "1"}
