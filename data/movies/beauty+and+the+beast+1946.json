She is drawn to the repellent but strangely fascinating Beast, who tests her fidelity by giving her a key, telling her that if she doesn't return it to him by a specific time, he will die of grief. She is unable to return the key on time, but it is revealed that the Beast is the genuinely handsome one. A simple tale of tragic love that turns into a surreal vision of death, desire, and beauty.", "popularity": "4.798852", "poster_path": "/bhGxt2YxlyO7x4GpliHEzI28H0z.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Discina", "id": 479}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1946-10-29", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 96, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.8", "vote_count": "133"}
