Whereas in Tattoo, Anna Magnani played a widow who could never find a man to measure up to her late husband, in Wind her character, Giola, marries widowed rancher Gino (Anthony Quinn), who is haunted by the memory of his first spouse. The situation is dicier in Wind, since Italian immigrant Gino's deceased wife was Giola's sister. Eventually tiring of her husband's mood swings, Giola turns to his son, Bene (Anthony Franciosa), for emotional and sexual gratification. A Hollywood approximation of the Italian neorealist school of filmmaking, Wild Is the Wind was based on Furia, a story by Vittorio Nino Novarese. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi", "popularity": "1.276352", "poster_path": "/rovWX2PUuUho5jnuEOGAD04n3qE.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Wallis-Hazen", "id": 87385}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1957-12-11", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 114, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.2", "vote_count": "3"}
