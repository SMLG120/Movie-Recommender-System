The victorious Nesib, Emir of Hobeika, lays down his peace terms to rival Amar, Sultan of Salmaah. The two men agree that neither can lay claim to the area of no man\u2019s land between them called The Yellow Belt. In return, Nesib adopts Amar\u2019s two boys Saleeh and Auda as a guarantee against invasion. Twelve years later, Saleeh and Auda have grown into young men. Saleeh, the warrior, itches to escape his gilded cage and return to his father\u2019s land. Auda cares only for books and the pursuit of knowledge. One day, their adopted father Nesib is visited by an American from Texas. He tells the Emir that his land is blessed with oil and promises him riches beyond his wildest imagination. Nesib imagines a realm of infinite possibility, a kingdom with roads, schools and hospitals all paid for by the black gold beneath the barren sand. There is only one problem. The precious oil is located in the Yellow Belt.", "popularity": "6.652197", "poster_path": "/iQd7zWhSeCe3cgdPcLIDXjGfdzL.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "France 2 Cin\u00e9ma", "id": 83}, {"name": "Quinta Communications", "id": 6370}, {"name": "Carthago Films S.a.r.l.", "id": 20395}, {"name": "Prima TV", "id": 60229}, {"name": "Doha Film Institute, The", "id": 72917}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}, {"iso_3166_1": "QA", "name": "Qatar"}, {"iso_3166_1": "TN", "name": "Tunisia"}], "release_date": "2011-12-21", "revenue": "5446000", "runtime": 130, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.9", "vote_count": "77"}
