Rosa gets Maya a job as a janitor: a non-union janitorial service has the contract, the foul-mouthed supervisor can fire workers on a whim, and the service-workers' union has assigned organizer Sam Shapiro to bring its \"justice for janitors\" campaign to the building. Sam finds Maya a willing listener, she's also attracted to him. Rosa resists, she has an ailing husband to consider. The workers try for public support; management intimidates workers to divide and conquer. Rosa and Maya as well as workers and management may be set to collide.", "popularity": "1.428582", "poster_path": "/7zEnvqFgD1JEHcsO5JbLcLWi4RO.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Alta Films S.A.", "id": 697}, {"name": "Parallax Pictures", "id": 983}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "ES", "name": "Spain"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}, {"iso_3166_1": "CH", "name": "Switzerland"}], "release_date": "2000-05-10", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 110, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.3", "vote_count": "14"}
