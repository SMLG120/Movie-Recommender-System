A mousy letter carrier makes dough balls she grotesquely ingests before bed. A shop clerk fixates on a TV news reader while he builds a machine to massage and masturbate him. One of his customers makes an elaborate chicken costume for a voodoo-like scene with a doll resembling his plump neighbor. She, in turn, has a doll that resembles him, which she whips and dominates in an abandoned church. The TV news reader has her own fantasy involving carp. Her husband, who is indifferent to her, steals materials to fashion elaborate artifacts that he rubs, scrapes and rolls across his body.", "popularity": "1.274652", "poster_path": "/x2jEm9vKkqRm54FQ31n1PWEgsf4.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Athanor", "id": 3554}, {"name": "Delfilm", "id": 26811}, {"name": "Cominici", "id": 26812}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CZ", "name": "Czech Republic"}, {"iso_3166_1": "CH", "name": "Switzerland"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "1996-10-17", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 83, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "cs", "name": "\u010cesk\u00fd"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.4", "vote_count": "16"}
