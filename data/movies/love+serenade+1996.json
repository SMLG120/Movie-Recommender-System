They are both dumbstruck by him and compete for his affections. While the attraction is by no means mutual, Ken \"sleaze-bag\" Sherry is more than willing to use the girls for his own sexual gratification.Vicki-Ann\u2019s naivety leads her to believe that they will marry, meanwhile, Dimity believes him to be a fish.When Vicki-Ann\u2019s proposal is rejected she climbs the grain silo to presumably contemplate suicide. Ken and Dimity come to talk to her and Ken ends up dying by falling off the tower- or was he pushed? The girls attempt to dispose of the body by dumping it in the river, however Dimity\u2019s fishy theory is proved true when Ken swims off towards the horizon.", "popularity": "0.881482", "poster_path": "/2WYt7hZ0q4xt9MJmBxBC3fjlhLl.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "New South Wales Film & Television Office", "id": 418}, {"name": "Australian Film Finance Corporation (AFFC)", "id": 8724}, {"name": "Film Victoria", "id": 11840}, {"name": "Jan Chapman Productions", "id": 14089}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "AU", "name": "Australia"}], "release_date": "1996-10-10", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 101, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Rumored", "vote_average": "6.0", "vote_count": "4"}
