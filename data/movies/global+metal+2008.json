The film follows metal fan and anthropologist Sam Dunn on a whirlwind journey through Asia, South America and the Middle East as he explores the underbelly of the world's emerging extreme music scenes; from Indonesian death metal to Chinese black metal to Iranian thrash metal. GLOBAL METAL reveals a worldwide community of metalheads who aren't just absorbing metal from the West - they're transforming it - creating a new form of cultural expression in societies dominated by conflict, corruption and mass-consumerism.", "popularity": "1.015014", "poster_path": "/cA9QUh8ajvkgBbyJt5hZjY2wrVK.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Banger Productions", "id": 3414}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}], "release_date": "2008-06-20", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 93, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.6", "vote_count": "19"}
