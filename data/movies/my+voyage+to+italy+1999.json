They had a powerful effect on me. You should see them.\" That's Martin Scorsese's message for this documentary. We meet his family on Elizabeth Street in New York; he's a third generation Italian with Sicilian roots. Starting in 1949, they watched movies on TV as well as in theaters, lots of Italian imports. Scorsese, with his narration giving a personal as well as a public context, shows extended clips of these movies. Films of Rossellini and De Sica fill part one; those of Visconti, Fellini, and Antonioni comprise part two. Scorsese takes time with emotion, style, staging, technique, political context, and cinematic influence. It's his movie family.", "popularity": "0.875175", "poster_path": "/r7h24a7r9mNsJwiKUZEmMhX5wHY.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Cappa Productions", "id": 691}, {"name": "MediaTrade", "id": 14582}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}], "release_date": "1999-09-11", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 246, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "it", "name": "Italiano"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.2", "vote_count": "13"}
