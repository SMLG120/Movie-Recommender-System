When Ashleigh was hired to voice Apple Jack and Rainbow Dash for Hasbro's fourth series to use the My Little Pony name - My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic - she had no idea she would become an Internet phenomenon and major celebrity to a worldwide fan-base of grownups. Bronies are united by their belief in the show's philosophy. This documentary gives an inside view of the Pony fan-world, and an intimate look at the courage it takes to just be yourself...even when that means liking a little girls' cartoon.", "popularity": "0.762451", "poster_path": "/ueKw9EKd2BULq2mOEMPeB87e36u.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Hodgee Films", "id": 27863}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "NZ", "name": "New Zealand"}, {"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2014-07-08", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 79, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.3", "vote_count": "9"}
