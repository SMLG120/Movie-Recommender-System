As a writer/director, he has crafted a supremely entertaining motion picture. ORPHANS tells the grittily realistic, hysterical, and deeply moving tale of a group of siblings who reunite in Glasgow on the eve of their mother's funeral. The four children mourn their mother's passing in a variety of ways, some of which are heartfelt and some of which are bizarre. As a potential thunderstorm threatens to damage the city, the situation compounds itself even further.", "popularity": "2.805298", "poster_path": "/jM4R3tn49pXE4o9WNnyXfc2FDS.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Antoinine Green Bridge", "id": 8255}, {"name": "Scottish Arts Council, The", "id": 8256}, {"name": "The Scottish Arts Council", "id": 8257}], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1998-09-03", "revenue": "49501", "runtime": 101, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.8", "vote_count": "7"}
