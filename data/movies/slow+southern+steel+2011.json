Shot in back alleys, parking lots, and the seedy  green rooms of the dirtiest clubs that the Bible Belt failed to snuff out,  these diehard musicians discuss their love of music and the south, as  well as the difficulties, contradictions, and insanity that haunt every  southern artist. There are no illusions here, no apologies,  no distractions - only the straight truth as told by those who would  know the difference. Narrated by the notorious Dixie Dave Collins  (Weedeater, Buzzov-en, Bongzilla), Slow Southern Steel is an  authentic and honest and thorough look at one of the most  remarkable music communities ever spawned on the continent.", "popularity": "0.00968", "poster_path": "/kDCxVu1lAoRbcsYgF4wiR6QsoKy.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2011-10-20", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "0.0", "vote_count": "0"}
