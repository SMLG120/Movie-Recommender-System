His most prized possession is his donkey. When his donkey falls terminally ill, Z\u00e9 makes a promise to Saint B\u00e1rbara: If his donkey recovers, he will carry a cross - like Jesus - all the way from his city to Saint B\u00e1rbara's church in the state capital. Upon the recover of his donkey, Z\u00e9 leaves on his journey.
