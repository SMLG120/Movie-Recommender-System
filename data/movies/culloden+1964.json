It portrays the 1746 Battle of Culloden that resulted in the British Army's destruction of the Scottish Jacobite uprising and, in the words of the narrator, \"tore apart forever the clan system of the Scottish Highlands\". Described in its opening credits as \"an account of one of the most mishandled and brutal battles ever fought in Britain\", Culloden was hailed as a breakthrough for its cinematography as well as its use of non-professional actors and its presentation of an historical event in the style of modern TV war reporting. The film was based on John Prebble's study of the battle.", "popularity": "0.727385", "poster_path": "/oKVFnfPrkhjcK4s73dcGjD4wi1k.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)", "id": 3324}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "1964-05-24", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 69, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "gd", "name": ""}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.5", "vote_count": "11"}
