Granny Orin is approaching 70, content to embrace her fate. Her widowed son Tatsuhei cannot bear losing his mother, even as she arranges his marriage to a widow his age. Her grandson Kesa, who's girlfriend is pregnant, is selfishly happy to see Orin die. Around them, a family of thieves are dealt with severely, and an old man, past 70, whose son has cast him out, scrounges for food. Will Orin's loving and accepting spirit teach and ennoble her family?", "popularity": "0.969254", "poster_path": "/AtWBZYDH5UxOqod0cxqFZ9RqWK8.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Shochiku Company", "id": 4641}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "JP", "name": "Japan"}], "release_date": "1958-06-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 98, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.4", "vote_count": "12"}
