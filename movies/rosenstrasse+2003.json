A stranger comes to the house - Ruth's cousin - with a picture of Ruth, age 8, in Berlin, with a woman the cousin says helped Ruth escape. Hannah, Ruth's daughter engaged to a gentile, goes to Berlin to find the woman, Lena Fisher, now 90. Posing as a journalist investigating intermarriage, Hannah interviews Lena who tells the story of a week in 1943 when the Jewish husbands of Aryan women were detained in a building on Rosenstrasse. The women gather daily for word of their husbands. The film goes back and forth to tell Ruth and Lena's story. How will it affect Hannah?", "popularity": "0.638808", "poster_path": "/qbvsfbESs8napwhPDrEec8y2I6E.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Studio Hamburg Letterbox Filmproduktion", "id": 2538}, {"name": "Tele M\u00fcnchen Fernseh Produktionsgesellschaft (TMG)", "id": 7237}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "NL", "name": "Netherlands"}], "release_date": "2003-09-18", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 136, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.5", "vote_count": "10"}
