The film is set during the tumultuous 1960s, an era when everyone's values were turned inside out, shaken around, and reassembled. The central character is first-generation American Craig Wasson, who confounds his Yugoslavian father (Miklos Simon) by pursuing his own let-it-all-hang-out lifestyle. Wasson's best friends are athlete Jim Metzler and chubby Michael Huddleston; all pursue the affections of bewitching Jodi Thelan. Though they are obviously deeply in love with one another, Wasson and Thelan continue to foolishly avoid a long-term commitment as the sixties unfold around them. Four Friends calls for a fresher approach than the one offered by director Arthur Penn, whose handling of the material is much too pat and old-fashioned.", "popularity": "0.337021", "poster_path": "/xCuGYk8j0xPAskBCifLapyk1QlV.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Filmways Pictures", "id": 1138}, {"name": "Cinema 77", "id": 1819}, {"name": "Geria Productions", "id": 11333}, {"name": "Florin", "id": 92940}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1981-12-11", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 115, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.0", "vote_count": "4"}
