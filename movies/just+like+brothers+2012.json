These three men, who have nothing in common, all shared one thing: their love for Charlie. One loved her like a sister, one loved her like the woman of his dreams, one loved her like a friend. Except that Charlie is dead and none of them - not Boris, an accomplished businessman, not Elie, a night owl scriptwriter, and not Maxime, still living at home with his mother - know how to deal with it. But because she asked them to do so, they abruptly decide to undertake a journey together, heading for Corsica and the house that Charlie loved so much. Except that here they are stuck in a car together for over 500 miles. It's going to be a long journey. Boris, Elie and Maxime, three men, three generations, no affinity. But by the time they arrive at their destination, they will have realized one majorly important thing: Charlie has changed their lives forever.", "popularity": "3.130494", "poster_path": "/9eMWXDRVhKJw2Y2OlRAzPtsL1Nv.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Cofinova 7", "id": 10610}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "2012-11-21", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 0, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.7", "vote_count": "55"}
