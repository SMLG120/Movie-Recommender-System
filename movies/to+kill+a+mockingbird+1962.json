The trial and the events surrounding it are seen through the eyes of Finch's six-year-old daughter, Scout. While Robinson's trial gives the movie its momentum, there are plenty of anecdotal occurrences before and after the court date: Scout's ever-strengthening bond with older brother, Jem, her friendship with precocious young Dill Harris, her father's no-nonsense reactions to such life-and-death crises as a rampaging mad dog, and especially Scout's reactions to, and relationship with, Boo Radley, the reclusive 'village idiot' who turns out to be her salvation when she is attacked by a venomous bigot.", "popularity": "14.284787", "poster_path": "/gQg6sPYfNTUlf8wEtydzWl09RyR.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Universal Pictures", "id": 33}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1962-12-25", "revenue": "13129846", "runtime": 129, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.9", "vote_count": "676"}
