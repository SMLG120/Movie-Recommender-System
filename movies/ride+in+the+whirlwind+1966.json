Come morning, a posse arrives, forms up along the ridge, and takes for granted that everyone down below is guilty--fit for either shooting to bits or hanging from a tree, whichever comes first. Precisely half of Ride in the Whirlwind's 82 minutes is devoted to tapping the matter-of-fact, absurdist horror of that situation. In the remaining half, the two surviving cowpokes (Jack Nicholson and Cameron Mitchell) seek shelter at a farmhouse where they reluctantly threaten the farmer, accept breakfast from his wife, flirt with his daughter (Millie Perkins), play some checkers, and hope to remain undetected till nightfall.", "popularity": "2.352893", "poster_path": "/koT8zrcSbwEniUA4impWfGJ9MGH.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Proteus Films", "id": 38111}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1966-10-23", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 82, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.0", "vote_count": "20"}
