However, top-secret US government agent 'Bob' arranges a staged death, so Maggie can be elaborately trained as a phantom killer and subdued into obedience. She gets a new cover identity as saleswoman Claudia Anne Doran. She also gets a wonderful house-mate, building super J.P., a broad-minded, gentle photographer. The two fall in love, and that complicates hit jobs. His good influence extends to breeding in her a conscience that places love over business, unlike Bob's agency.", "popularity": "11.113039", "poster_path": "/kOfSTm2cftavsyB49amnhW3is9y.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Warner Bros.", "id": 6194}, {"name": "Art Linson Productions", "id": 8769}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1993-03-19", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 108, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.0", "vote_count": "134"}
