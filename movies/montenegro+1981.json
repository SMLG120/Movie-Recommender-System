Her behavior is bizarre, perhaps mad: she poisons the dog's milk and advises the dog not to drink it; she sets the sheets afire as her husband sleeps; she crawls under the dining table to sing. While detained at airport customs for carrying pruning shears, she meets a young Yugoslav woman and goes with her to a Gypsy enclave where she's fought over, takes a lover, helps with the sordid entertainment at a bar, and returns home more dangerous than before. The film also tells parallel stories of Marilyn's daughter becoming a junior homemaker as the young immigrant practices her striptease.", "popularity": "0.011917", "poster_path": "/6SofG7GZRmafUBkleXCgoeIGyEJ.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Smart Egg Pictures", "id": 1531}, {"name": "Europa Film", "id": 1763}, {"name": "Viking Film", "id": 44438}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "SE", "name": "Sweden"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "1981-10-09", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 96, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "sv", "name": "svenska"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.7", "vote_count": "7"}
