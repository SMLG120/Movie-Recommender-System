He courts and marries the warm-hearted Kristina, not out of love but because she is highly knowledgeable in the skills of the operating room and because she has frugally put aside her savings through the years. She will be, as he shrewdly knows, a supportive wife in every way. She helps make him the success he wants to be and cheerfully moves with him to the small town in which he starts his practice. But as much as he tries to be a good husband to the undemanding Kristina, Marsh easily falls into the arms of a local siren and the patience of the long-sorrowing Kristina wears thin.", "popularity": "0.294175", "poster_path": "/ulRX0PeUqVakua8WZDGCaWbQOP7.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "United Artists", "id": 60}, {"name": "Stanley Kramer Productions", "id": 893}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1955-07-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 135, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.2", "vote_count": "6"}
