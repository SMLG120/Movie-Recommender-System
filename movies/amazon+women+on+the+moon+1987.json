Centered around a television station which features a 1950s-style sci-fi movie interspersed with a series of wild commercials, wacky shorts and weird specials, this lampoon of contemporary life and pop culture skewers some of the silliest spectacles ever created in the name of entertainment. A truly outrageous look at the best of the worst that television has to offer.", "popularity": "2.646976", "poster_path": "/wsvlMJf8Hkw63Msk8lGIEPHyWsN.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Universal Pictures", "id": 33}, {"name": "Westward Productions", "id": 19909}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1987-09-18", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 85, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.0", "vote_count": "37"}
