Unable to write enough to keep his publisher's royalty advances coming, he seeks out a woman he imagines is a prostitute and interviews her for material. He is also inspired to utter some poetry, which his brassy, outspoken wife identifies as coming from the famous homosexuality-advocating mystical German poet, Stefan George. This inspires Walter to take a closer look at the gay scene, and he quickly becomes a sort of celebrity there.", "popularity": "0.416417", "poster_path": "/5qb3S94BNtnhLQQtkNR5XvoGGHM.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Albatros Filmproduktion", "id": 8568}, {"name": "Trio Film", "id": 33352}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}], "release_date": "1976-10-07", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 113, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.9", "vote_count": "7"}
