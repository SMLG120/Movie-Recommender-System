The women, in particular Elvira find it extremely difficult to accept their mothers sudden apparent sexual reversal. The news pushes the neurotic Elvira to the point of nervous breakdown. Sol, the youngest daughter, writes a lude rock song about it and performs in front of them at a concert. The daughters plot together on how to get their mothers new girlfriend, a native Czech, and brilliant pianist, out of her life. Their plot goes terribly wrong and turns the film from a light-hearted comedy, into mildly amusing drama.\"", "popularity": "1.068925", "poster_path": "/sByK1IBvjpSt5HGkJSHxAIWNaV8.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "ES", "name": "Spain"}], "release_date": "2002-01-11", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 93, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "cs", "name": "\u010cesk\u00fd"}, {"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.1", "vote_count": "7"}
