Before they do that, they try to investigate on the heroism of the Philippine national hero. Of particular focus is his supposed retraction of his views against the Roman Catholic Church during the Spanish regime in the Philippines which he expressed primarily through his two novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. The investigation was done mainly by \"interviewing\" key individuals in the life of Rizal such as his mother Teodora Alonso, his siblings Paciano, Trinidad, and Narcisa, his love interest and supposed wife Josephine Bracken, and the Jesuit priest who supposedly witnessed Rizal's retraction, Fr. Balaguer. Eventually, the two filmmakers would end up \"interviewing\" Rizal himself to get to the bottom of the issue.", "popularity": "0.147723", "poster_path": "/fYKkIguAhOMrcUeeKiiYUB7pdkA.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Cinema Artists", "id": 14070}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "PH", "name": "Philippines"}], "release_date": "2000-02-16", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 93, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "tl", "name": ""}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "8.5", "vote_count": "2"}
