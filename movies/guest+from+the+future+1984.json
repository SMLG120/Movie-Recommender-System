Accidentally, Kolya witnesses two space pirates who arrive from Saturn and later try to steal a device called a \"Mielophone\" (which can read thoughts) from Alisa Seleznyova - a girl that performs experiments with this device and animals. Kolya manages to save the device from the pirates and brings it back to the 20th century. But both pirates and Alisa get there too.
