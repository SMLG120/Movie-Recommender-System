The Soviet army mounts a counter-attack on the Nazi forces that occupy half of Stalingrad on the other side of the Volga, but the operation to cross the river is unsuccessful. A few soldiers who managed to get to the other side take refuge in a house on the bank of Volga. Here they find a girl who didn\u2019t escape when the Germans came. While the whole might of the German army descends onto them, the heroes of Stalingrad experience love, loss, joy and the sense of ultimate freedom that can only be felt by those about to die. They defend the house at all costs while the Red Army prepares for another attack.", "popularity": "0.595196", "poster_path": "/4qw1kuMxdIwXuniOXRAJLlRNWO1.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Art Pictures Studio", "id": 3451}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "RU", "name": "Russia"}], "release_date": "2013-10-09", "revenue": "68129518", "runtime": 131, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "ru", "name": "P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.7", "vote_count": "93"}
