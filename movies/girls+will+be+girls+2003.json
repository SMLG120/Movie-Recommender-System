The tension among the trio of women escalates as Evie prepares for a pull-out-all-the-stops television special commemorating her past career glories, which include sundry disaster movies and TV variety shows. What Evie doesn't know is that the na\u00efve-seeming Varla has a debt to settle for her deceased mom, and will stop at nothing to seek vengeance.", "popularity": "0.450419", "poster_path": "/lFrZNE2ekEL7y9RxtaxnDjq4Ca1.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "SRO Pictures", "id": 3896}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2003-07-05", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 79, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.0", "vote_count": "9"}
