Instead of going to Vietnam, Wordsworth goes off to fight against the French while Coleridge stays at home and promotes utopianism. After the war, the poets live and work together with Coleridge's wife, Sara (Samantha Morton), and Wordsworth's sister, Dorothy (Emily Woof). At first this communal arrangement works to the advantage of Coleridge--who does some of his best writing while Wordsworth stagnates--until Coleridge becomes addicted to opium. Wordsworth, meanwhile, doesn't find his voice until he abandons his friend. In 20th-century vernacular, Wordsworth is the yuppie, Coleridge the hippie.", "popularity": "0.660969", "poster_path": "/6FM55qmxSVhZnoziqLh3vfytIJy.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Arts Council of England", "id": 718}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2001-06-29", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 124, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "4.5", "vote_count": "2"}
