A slacker before there was a word for it, Andrzej (played by Skolimowski himself) drifts through a series of open-ended encounters with women following a wake-up argument with his pouting wife, and a long-delayed military physical (the film\u2019s title derives from one of the questions). Skolimowski hoarded four years\u2019 worth of the annual film footage allotment from his L\u00f3dz film school in order to create this first feature marked by compositional bravado and a trademark air of the absurd. -Barbara Scharres, Gene Siskel Film Center", "popularity": "1.082036", "poster_path": "/7ZmHXX3W7mSMK6JqMCyPtxDFgQV.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "PL", "name": "Poland"}], "release_date": "1965-11-18", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 73, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "pl", "name": "Polski"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.5", "vote_count": "2"}
