Despite remaining one of the most masterful of French directors, Cluozot inexplicably seems to have lost control on the big-budget production of L\u2019Enfer. The long-lost raw footage is intriguing and dazzling, infused with swirling lights and blue-lipped, cigarette-puffing fantasy temptresses. Although directors Serge Bromberg and Ruxandra Mederea have managed to speak to numerous members of the original crew, this behind-the-scenes investigation has so little to say about the reasons behind Clouzot\u2019s failure to complete the film. In spite of this, the undiminished power of Clouzot\u2019s extraordinary images makes the documentary a fascinating watch.", "popularity": "0.766398", "poster_path": "/sIsuKyYpxg95OegSDF6L2Zrf4mK.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "2009-10-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 102, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.5", "vote_count": "11"}
