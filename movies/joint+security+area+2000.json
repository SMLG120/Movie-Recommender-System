But the 11 bullets found in the bodies, together with the 5 remaining bullets in the assassin's magazine clip, amount to 16 bullets for a gun that should normally hold 15 bullets. The investigating Swiss/Swedish team from the neutral countries overseeing the DMZ suspects that another, unknown party was involved - all of which points to some sort of cover up. The truth is much simpler and much more tragic.", "popularity": "10.187128", "poster_path": "/iTB01AX6We1h8CAJql55dUyvSWq.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Myung Film Company", "id": 2479}, {"name": "CJ Entertainment", "id": 7036}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "KR", "name": "South Korea"}], "release_date": "2000-09-09", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 110, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "ko", "name": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4/\uc870\uc120\ub9d0"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.7", "vote_count": "115"}
