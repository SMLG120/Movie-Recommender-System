There is no treatment. There is no cure. Enter Doctors Leslie Gordon and Scott Berns. When their son, Sam, was diagnosed with progeria at age two, the prognosis was grim\u2014the couple were simply told to enjoy the few years they had left with their only son\u2014but they weren\u2019t willing to give up that easily.
