Jacques (Jean-Marc Barr) and Enzo (Jean Reno) are a pair of friends who have been close since childhood, and who share a passion for the dangerous sport of free diving. Professional diver Jacques opted to follow in the footsteps of his father, who died at sea when Jacques was a boy; to the bewilderment of scientists, Jacques harbors a remarkable ability to adjust his heart rate and breathing pattern in the water, so that his vital signs more closely resemble that of dolphins than men (he even considers a school of dolphins as his extended family).  As Enzo persuades a reluctant Jacques to compete against him in a free diving contest -- determining who can dive deeper and longer without scuba gear -- Jacques meets Johana (Rosanna Arquette), a beautiful insurance investigator from America, and he finds that he must choose between his love for her and his love of the sea.", "popularity": "13.503815", "poster_path": "/w4TWqa7SiXP0Hm4rkRnCfXwIeRK.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Gaumont", "id": 9}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1988-05-11", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 168, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "it", "name": "Italiano"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.6", "vote_count": "364"}
