When his girlfriend Nadine up and moves to Shanghai, a love-sick Zinos decides to fly after her, leaving his restaurant in the hands of his unreliable ex-con brother Illias. Both decisions turn out disastrous: Illias gambles away the restaurant to a shady real estate agent, and Zinos finds Nadine with a new lover. If the brothers can stop arguing and get it together, the Soul Kitchen might still have one last chance at staying in business. The mayhem that follows is a hilariously entertaining story of self-realization, set to an irresistibly soulful soundtrack.", "popularity": "4.79386", "poster_path": "/vUxpCAViRHmW4iIuAiwUxisQ5Wz.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Coraz\u00f3n International", "id": 200}, {"name": "Biograf Jan Sv\u011br\u00e1k", "id": 6419}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}], "release_date": "2009-09-09", "revenue": "17872796", "runtime": 99, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "el", "name": "\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.0", "vote_count": "117"}
