Curmudgeonly old Frank lives by himself. His routine involves daily visits to his local library, where he has a twinkle in his eye for the librarian. His grown children are concerned about their father\u2019s well-being and buy him a caretaker robot. Initially resistant to the idea, Frank soon appreciates the benefits of robotic support \u2013 like nutritious meals and a clean house \u2013 and eventually begins to treat his robot like a true companion. With his robot\u2019s assistance, Frank\u2019s passion for his old, unlawful profession is reignited, for better or worse.", "popularity": "9.291494", "poster_path": "/euOI0iOczBCEQgPhToZcvQ2eIj7.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Samuel Goldwyn Films", "id": 9118}, {"name": "Stage 6 Films", "id": 11341}, {"name": "Park Pictures", "id": 13466}, {"name": "TBB", "id": 13467}, {"name": "Dog Run Pictures", "id": 13468}, {"name": "White Hat", "id": 13469}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2012-08-16", "revenue": "3325038", "runtime": 85, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.8", "vote_count": "454"}
