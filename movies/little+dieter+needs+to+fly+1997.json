Barefoot, surviving monsoons, leeches, and machete-wielding villagers, he was rescued. Now, near 60, living on Mt. Tamalpais, Dengler tells his story: a German lad surviving Allied bombings in World War II, postwar poverty, apprenticed to a smith, beaten regularly. At 18, he emigrates and peels potatoes in the U.S. Air Force. He leaves for California and college, then enlistment in the Navy to learn to fly. A quiet man of sorrows tells his story: war, capture, harrowing conditions, escape, and miraculous rescue. Where did he find the strength; how does he now live with his memories?", "popularity": "1.014863", "poster_path": "/pvLBVoQ7mrK2zX3UGD0qZzvMYax.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Werner Herzog Filmproduktion", "id": 843}, {"name": "Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF)", "id": 4606}, {"name": "ZDF Enterprises", "id": 5747}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "1997-12-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 80, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.8", "vote_count": "25"}
