She lives in a Paris suburb with her son and her husband Pierre, a pilot. Her lover is Robert, an actor. Assignations with him, dinner with her husband and a client, consulting a physician: there's tension at home, Pierre had her followed a few months before, their marital play has an edge, Pierre slaps her and apologizes. She quizzes Robert: is he acting when he's with her? Events may force her to choose Robert or Pierre. Close-ups fill the screen; is there more than surface? Her eyes tear up. The horrors of war provide a distant counterpoint.", "popularity": "0.998151", "poster_path": "/wmI5LfAhIdRnVWlWJTXiFdXiJLz.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Orsay Films", "id": 2325}, {"name": "Anouchka Films", "id": 14679}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1964-12-04", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 95, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.1", "vote_count": "21"}
