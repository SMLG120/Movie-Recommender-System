Agnes Von Krusenstjarna (Stina Ekbland) was a Swedish novelist (1894-1940) whose works ranged from the idyllically romantic to crushingly sardonic, sexually explicit autobiography. Von Krusenstjarna teamed up with the eccentric bisexual David Sprengel (Erland Josephson) and continued to suffer bouts of mental instability that Sprengel felt were best cured by sexual abandon. Von Krusenstjarna was not a model of emotional health when she first met Sprengel. She had inherited madness from her family while at the same time passionately rebelled against the narrow-minded mores of her genteel but poor parents. With his own wildly unorthodox behavior, Sprengel both helped and hindered Von Krusenstjarna throughout their turbulent relationship.", "popularity": "0.932271", "poster_path": "/rXqnEUbFu06Xl49BNawBfd9ojDx.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Sandrew Film & Teater AB", "id": 10507}], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1986-03-14", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 0, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "sv", "name": "svenska"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.0", "vote_count": "2"}
