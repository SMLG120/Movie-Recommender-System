The purpose of the expedition was to prove Heyerdal's theory that the Polynesian Islands were populated from the east---specifically Peru---rather than from the west (Asia) as had been the theory for hundreds of years. Heyerdahl made a study of the winds and tides in the Pacific, and by simulating conditions as closely as possible to those he theorized the Peruvians encountered, set out on the voyage.", "popularity": "1.006239", "poster_path": "/miZKTcEMzmlrIsKxKdUNJlH3vRm.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "NO", "name": "Norway"}, {"iso_3166_1": "SE", "name": "Sweden"}], "release_date": "1950-01-12", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 58, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "no", "name": "Norsk"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.5", "vote_count": "12"}
