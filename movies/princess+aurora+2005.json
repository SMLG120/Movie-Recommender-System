No one imagines this could lead to serial murders, but two days after the first murder, another homicide occurs. A woman is suffocated to death and the only evidence left at the crime scene is a sticker of the cartoon character \"Princess Aurora\". A veteran detective OH suspects an attractive and lively woman named JUNG Soon-jung as the murderer. However, he does not tell anyone -not even his partner- that Jung also happens to be his ex-wife. Again and again, the Princess Aurora sticker is found... each with a dead body.", "popularity": "1.092424", "poster_path": "/wb3Ck52AlzG2n7PfmMQf4TVCqRH.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Cinema Service", "id": 868}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "KR", "name": "South Korea"}], "release_date": "2005-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 106, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ko", "name": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4/\uc870\uc120\ub9d0"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.4", "vote_count": "15"}
