The film's legendary reputation is due to the astonishing range of techniques that Gance uses to tell his story, culminating in the final twenty-minute triptych sequence, which alternates widescreen panoramas with complex multiple- image montages projected simultaneously on three screens.", "popularity": "1.742727", "poster_path": "/5b1RQrA5qSfqCgVsErRKz9C9chU.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Path\u00e9 Consortium Cin\u00e9ma", "id": 220}, {"name": "Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des films", "id": 1237}, {"name": "Films Abel Gance", "id": 9005}, {"name": "Isepa-Wengeroff Film GmbH", "id": 9006}, {"name": "Cin\u00e9 France", "id": 27693}, {"name": "Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Westi", "id": 82280}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1927-11-14", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 332, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.9", "vote_count": "28"}
