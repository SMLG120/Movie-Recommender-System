Avid movie-watcher and video store clerk Bazil has had his life all but ruined by weapons of war. His father was killed by a landmine in Morocco and one fateful night a stray bullet from a nearby shootout embeds itself in his skull, leaving him on the verge of instantaneous death. Losing his job and his home, Bazil wanders the streets until he meets Slammer, a pardoned convict who introduces him to a band of eccentric junkyard dealers including Calculator, a math expert and statistician, Buster, a record-holder in human cannonball feats, Tiny Pete, an artistic craftsman of automatons, and Elastic Girl, a sassy contortionist. When chance reveals to Bazil the two weapons manufacturers responsible for building the instruments of his destruction, he constructs a complex scheme for revenge that his newfound family is all too happy to help set in motion.", "popularity": "5.278672", "poster_path": "/lgilU7TzFXhZWX39iYsEwJFdPKE.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "France 2 Cin\u00e9ma", "id": 83}, {"name": "France 3 Cin\u00e9ma", "id": 591}, {"name": "Epith\u00e8te Films", "id": 7286}, {"name": "France 3 (FR 3)", "id": 11244}, {"name": "R\u00e9gion Ile-de-France", "id": 11246}, {"name": "France 2 (FR2)", "id": 11359}, {"name": "Orange Cin\u00e9ma S\u00e9ries", "id": 11620}, {"name": "Tapioca Films", "id": 12000}, {"name": "Warner Bros.
