Pookie Adams - a kooky, lonely misfit with no family and no place to go, insists on calling all those who won't participate in her world, \"weirdos,\" clings to a quiet studious Jerry, who has the ability to make a choice of living in Pookie's private little world or be accepted by the society that Pookie rejects. Unwittingly, it is through their awkward relationship that Pookie actually prepares Jerry for the world of \"weirdos\" that she doesn't fit into or wish to be apart of.", "popularity": "0.454271", "poster_path": "/nUAp6h1D4SyBzx0QSaoTWZx6HCe.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Paramount Pictures", "id": 4}, {"name": "Boardwalk Productions", "id": 5771}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1969-10-22", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 107, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "4.1", "vote_count": "6"}
