Via ventriloquism, Pin explains bodily functions in a way kids can relate to. When the over-strict doctor and his wife are killed in a car crash, his son (Leon) transfers his alter-ego into Pin, whom he always believed was alive. He starts using Pin as an excuse to over-protect his sister (Ursula) from admirers and deflect unwanted intrusions, even to the extent of committing murder.", "popularity": "2.089317", "poster_path": "/7HcNDVQooAnsbd955GEyUIEX43P.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Lance Entertainment", "id": 15103}, {"name": "Malofilm Communications Inc.", "id": 18218}, {"name": "Image Organization", "id": 21084}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}], "release_date": "1988-11-25", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 103, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.6", "vote_count": "31"}
