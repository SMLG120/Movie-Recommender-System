Which man will be left standing? Touching down in four hotbeds of religious fundamentalism - Pakistan, Lebanon, UK, and heartland America - HolyWars goes behind the scenes of the 1400 year old conflict between Islam and Christianity. The film follows a danger-seeking Christian missionary and a radical Muslim Irish convert, both of whom believe in an apocalyptic battle, after which their religion will ultimately rule the world. Tracking their lives from the onset of the \"War on Terror\" to the election of Barack Obama, HolyWars shows that even the most radical of believers can be transformed by our changing world", "popularity": "0.175871", "poster_path": "/c5Cp1FxVAsoiZiCmlDYXB2LIeH7.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2010-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 60, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "8.0", "vote_count": "1"}
