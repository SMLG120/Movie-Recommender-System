When a shipyard closes, Liam and Teresa's dad loses his job. Liam, who's about 8, making his first Holy Communion, gets a regular dose of fire and brimstone at church. Teresa, about 13, has a job as a maid to the Jewish family that owns the closed shipyard. The lady of that house is having an affair, and Teresa becomes an accomplice. Liam stutters terribly, especially when troubled. Dad comes under the sway of the Fascists, who blame cheap Irish labor and Jewish owners. A Molotov cocktail brings things to a head.", "popularity": "1.54417", "poster_path": "/kith4VihfjgJXfFI40hobWkWEGw.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)", "id": 3324}, {"name": "Road Movies Filmproduktion", "id": 8366}, {"name": "Liam Films", "id": 39237}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2000-09-04", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.3", "vote_count": "10"}
