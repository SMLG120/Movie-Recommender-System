Six years alone. Six years keeping his mouth shut about the robbery, about the other men involved. The night he is released, the four men he protected with silence celebrate his freedom with a congratulatory dinner.

Sure enough, the four unwieldy thieves can't help but open old wounds in an attempt to find their missing loot.", "popularity": "5.538648", "poster_path": "/z9kh59TlbqpRlHQE0yE2oAn1yFR.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2012-12-07", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 98, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.4", "vote_count": "46"}
