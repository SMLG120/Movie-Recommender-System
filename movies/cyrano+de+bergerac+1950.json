Cyrano de Bergerac is a play written in 1897 by Edmond Rostand. Although there was a real Cyrano de Bergerac, the play is a fictionalization of his life that follows the broad outlines of it. The entire play is written in verse, in rhyming couplets of twelve syllables per line, very close to the Alexandrine format, but the verses sometimes lack a caesura. It is also meticulously researched, down to the names of the members of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise and the dames pr\u00e9cieuses glimpsed before the performance in the first scene. The play has been translated and performed many times, and is responsible for introducing the word \"panache\" into the English language.", "popularity": "4.617", "poster_path": "/2aF7OTp5kzNzpu3hfS2NVtYz6R9.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Stanley Kramer Productions", "id": 893}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1950-11-14", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 112, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.9", "vote_count": "6"}
