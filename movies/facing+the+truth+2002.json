A success story on the face of it, but a story about a man - who is none other than the director's father - a man of powerful emotions. The film explores the nature and origin of the guilt that repeatedly deprived him of happiness.", "popularity": "1.179277", "poster_path": "/1nC58oqf4arg50bIl3csqgQCX3n.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Nordisk Film Production", "id": 14757}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DK", "name": "Denmark"}], "release_date": "2002-10-24", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 98, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "da", "name": "Dansk"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.7", "vote_count": "7"}
