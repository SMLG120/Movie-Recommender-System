The first sequence is a simple demonstration of the canon \"Frere Jacques\" where four cubes dance and combine with one another on a checkerboard. The second sequence show four little human-like figures dancing in space. The third and most elaborate sequence shows a human going through several strange gesticulations. Through multiple printing we realize that the man, as in the previous sequences, is part of a visual canon and is making the gestures to himself. As we hear variations on the canonic theme so too do we witness visual variations: a woman and cat enters the canon. To show the musical technique of inversion, the image of the man is printed upside down.", "popularity": "0.249773", "poster_path": "/tVak6LU9iBSl3v0B1mcPYAtjQoQ.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1964-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 10, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.5", "vote_count": "2"}
