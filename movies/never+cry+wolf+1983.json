In his struggle to survive in that difficult environment he studies the wolves, and realizes that the old beliefs about wolves and their supposed threat are almost totally false. Furthermore, he learns that humans represent a far greater threat to the land, and also to the wolves, a species which plays an important role in the ecosystem of the north.", "popularity": "3.464922", "poster_path": "/jUQ8RkdrQ9ubP8IV3bGvZIlDAcF.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Walt Disney Productions", "id": 3166}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1983-10-07", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 105, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "iu", "name": ""}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.9", "vote_count": "36"}
