In Toshio Matsumoto\u2019s controversial debut feature, seemingly nothing is taboo: neither the incorporation of visual flourishes straight from the worlds of contemporary graphic-design, painting, comic-books, and animation; nor the unflinching depiction of nudity, sex, drug-use, and public-toilets. But of all the \u201ctransgressions\u201d here on display, perhaps one in particular stands out the most: the film\u2019s groundbreaking and unapologetic portrayal of Japanese gay subculture.", "popularity": "3.502077", "poster_path": "/v2HfNo9eLNHvN6Rh9BQiJBVGDPQ.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Art Theatre Guild", "id": 9181}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "JP", "name": "Japan"}], "release_date": "1969-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 104, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.1", "vote_count": "21"}
