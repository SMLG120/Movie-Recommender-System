He's a failed NYC indie rocker, and a failing booking agent. But he finds the potential of a small victory in a really bad idea. He decides to purchase a 1985 Lazy Boy on eBay, just like the one his dad had when Josh was a kid. He'll drive cross-country for the chair, staying with Emily at his brother's house on the way, and deliver it to his father as a surprise birthday gift. But when Rhett ends up coming along for the ride, it's three people and a giant purple puffy chair in a too-small van... and one of them has to go before the trip's end.", "popularity": "0.709745", "poster_path": "/A8OdrYsEHhJDXWo8TC1EB0OmPkE.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2005-01-17", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 85, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.2", "vote_count": "15"}
