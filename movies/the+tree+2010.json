That was until one day fate struck blindly, taking the life of Peter, the father, leaving his grief-stricken wife Dawn alone with their four children. Among them, eight-year-old Simone denies this reality. She is persuaded that her father still lives in the giant fig tree growing near their house and speaks to her through its leaves.

Of course, Simone won't allow it.", "popularity": "2.288156", "poster_path": "/qssPD0KdPwqjfci8lNoEwGkuUBr.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Kojo Pictures", "id": 988}, {"name": "Tatfilm Produktionsges. mbH", "id": 1758}, {"name": "Dorje Film", "id": 1760}, {"name": "Les Films du Poisson", "id": 2426}, {"name": "Canal+", "id": 5358}, {"name": "Backup Films", "id": 5381}, {"name": "Goalpost Pictures", "id": 6748}, {"name": "Arte France Cin\u00e9ma", "id": 6916}, {"name": "Screen Australia", "id": 7584}, {"name": "Taylor Media", "id": 10945}, {"name": "WDR/Arte", "id": 10946}, {"name": "ARD Degeto Film", "id": 10947}, {"name": "La Pacte", "id": 10948}, {"name": "Memento Films International", "id": 10949}, {"name": "Screen Queensland", "id": 10950}, {"name": "Screen NSW", "id": 10951}, {"name": "Coficup 2", "id": 10952}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "AU", "name": "Australia"}, {"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}], "release_date": "2010-05-23", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 100, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.7", "vote_count": "36"}
