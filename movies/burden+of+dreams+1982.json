Documentary filmmaker Les Blank captured the unfolding of this production, made more perilous by Herzog\u2019s determination to shoot the most daunting scenes without models or special effects, including a sequence requiring hundreds of native Indians to pull a full-size, 320-ton steamship over a small mountain. The result is an extraordinary document of the filmmaking process and a unique look into the single-minded mission of one of cinema\u2019s most fearless directors.", "popularity": "2.712121", "poster_path": "/xof9qWnk2hZ83VThQfjBFfj6F5a.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Flower Films", "id": 2214}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1982-05-30", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 95, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.7", "vote_count": "28"}
