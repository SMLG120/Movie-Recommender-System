Following Nim's extraordinary journey through human society, and the enduring impact he makes on the people he meets along the way, the film is an unflinching and unsentimental biography of an animal we tried to make human. What we learn about his true nature - and indeed our own - is comic, revealing and profoundly unsettling.", "popularity": "9.765195", "poster_path": "/6xcLVto9Gc0Yk1lUxKif18KbChj.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "BBC Films", "id": 288}, {"name": "Passion Pictures", "id": 11594}, {"name": "Red Box Films", "id": 12840}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2011-07-08", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 93, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.8", "vote_count": "52"}
