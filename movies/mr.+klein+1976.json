Robert Klein cannot find any fault with the state of affairs in German-occupied France. He has a well-furnished flat, a mistress, and business is booming. Jews facing discrimination because of laws edicted by the French government are desperate to sell valuable works of art - and it is easy for him to get them at bargain prices. His cosy life is disrupted when he realizes that there is another Robert Klein in Paris - a Jew with a rather mysterious behaviour. Very soon, this homonymy attracts the close - and menacing - attention of the police on the established art trader.", "popularity": "6.298305", "poster_path": "/jDzw7kuphPHb1Vf4Sr7nh5o4aoa.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Adel Productions", "id": 1713}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1976-05-08", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 123, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.3", "vote_count": "24"}
