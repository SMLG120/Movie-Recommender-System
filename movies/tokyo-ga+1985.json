He made fifty-four films. Silent films in the Twenties, black-and-white films in the Thirties and Forties, and finally colour films until his death on December 12th, 1963, on his sixtieth birthday. Ozu's work does not need my praise and such a sacred treasure of the cinema could only reside in the realm of the imagination. And so, my trip to Tokyo was in no way a pilgrimage. I was curious as to whether I still could track down something from this time, whether there was still anything left of this work. Images perhaps, or even people\u2026 Or whether so much would have changed in Tokyo in the twenty years since Ozu's death that nothing would be left to find.", "popularity": "2.306683", "poster_path": "/vZkce81CO7xU7lKOO1jAVkcAV7d.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Chris Sievernich Filmproduktion", "id": 7949}, {"name": "Westdeutscher Rundfunk", "id": 7950}, {"name": "Grey City", "id": 7951}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}, {"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}], "release_date": "1985-04-26", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 92, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.8", "vote_count": "13"}
