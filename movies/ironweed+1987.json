Francis Phelan and Helen Archer are bums, back in their birth city. She was a singer on the radio, he a major league pitcher. Death surrounds them: she's sick, a pal has cancer, he digs graves at the cemetery and visits the grave of his infant son whom he dropped; visions of his past haunt him, including ghosts of two men he killed. That night, out drinking, Helen tries to sing at a bar. Next day, Fran visits his wife and children and meets a grandson. He could stay, but decides it's not for him. Helen gets their things out of storage and finds a hotel. Amidst their mistakes and dereliction, the film explores their code of fairness and loyalty.", "popularity": "2.601933", "poster_path": "/vijsvqtznJ7MDrRqxVoVfGkYdlr.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Keith Barish Productions", "id": 964}, {"name": "TAFT Entertainment Pictures", "id": 965}, {"name": "Home Box Office (HBO)", "id": 3268}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1987-12-18", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 143, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.4", "vote_count": "30"}
