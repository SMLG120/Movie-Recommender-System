New Orleans is the setting for Getting Back to Abnormal, a film that serves up a provocative mix of race, corruption and politics to tell the story of the re-election campaign of Stacy Head, a white woman in a city council seat traditionally held by a black representative. Supported by her irrepressible African-American aide Barbara Lacen-Keller, Head polarizes the city as her candidacy threatens to diminish the power and influence of its black citizens. Featuring a cast of characters as colorful as the city itself, the film presents a New Orleans that outsiders rarely see.", "popularity": "0.000177", "poster_path": "/cHfia1ZGF6I4KnyBa8jxDTmoBsb.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "null", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 92, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "0.0", "vote_count": "0"}
