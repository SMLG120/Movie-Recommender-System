Jack is from a wealthy background but left his parents as he resented their posh lives, and Cecil is a Native American half-breed seeking his own path in life away from his father. Both hustle and rustle their way in the world by targeting cattle owned by wealthy ranch owner John Brown. Frustrated that someone is killing his cattle, John hires a pair of ranch hands Burt and Curt to find the rustlers. When Brown realizes he cannot trust his two inept ranch hands, he turns to the grizzled former rustler Henry Beige to find the cattle thieves, while Jack and Cecil are always one step ahead of them, not realizing that their luck will eventually run out sometime.", "popularity": "1.211911", "poster_path": "/2moEBKgKvqLCEN1zC6I1XpA1BVr.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Elliott Kastner Productions", "id": 14391}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1975-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 93, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.5", "vote_count": "7"}
