Sir Ernest Pease (Robertson-Justice) is a self-important scientist who is sent undercover on a bombing mission to monitor the effectiveness of his latest invention, a new-fangled radar. When the plane is attacked, he parachutes to safety - only to be sent to a POW camp, where he takes on the alias of Lieutenant Farrow. There, the somewhat happy-go-lucky bunch of Brits suspect their acerbic new fellow prisoner of being a spy, and all sorts of culture clashes and misunderstandings ensue.", "popularity": "0.424395", "poster_path": "/tpF3WBW5GN5wid0PtxnY0yPd3t5.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Independent Artists", "id": 4913}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "1961-04-24", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 98, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "4.9", "vote_count": "5"}
