A ribald yet wonderfully delicate comedy, Memories of the Yellow House traces the indecisive, dangerous ripening of erotic fantasy as Jo\u00e3o\u2019s voyeuristic rituals push him to further, unexpected extremes. The rich mellowing of Monteiro\u2019s political address is embodied in the figure of the boarding house whose sanctimonious and narcissistic landlady is both a loose metaphor for the repressive, reactionary tendencies of postwar Portuguese society and an affectionately comic figure.", "popularity": "0.002001", "poster_path": "/s3YLp5qaWYmLnW3bh6046foiyYj.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Invicta Filmes", "id": 80968}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "PT", "name": "Portugal"}], "release_date": "1989-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 122, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "pt", "name": "Portugu\u00eas"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "8.5", "vote_count": "4"}
