In the late 1970s, Erik is accepted by the Danish National Film School where he enters a world of angry and unhelpful tutors, weird fellow students and unwritten rules. In this both exhilarating and angst-provoking period for him, Erik feels increasingly like a foreigner in the film industry. Frequently, he is merely an observer of the absurdities that surround him. He encounters trade union disputes, falls in love and experiences self-assured empowered women who refuse to make a commitment. The film is a drama full of comedy - a sharp portrait of a conceited but entertaining world of film which we suspect our dogged young director will eventually conquer with his vision.", "popularity": "1.294067", "poster_path": "/qEAJsiBVMPQc2INIYrgmah4rlk.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Zentropa Entertainments", "id": 76}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "DK", "name": "Denmark"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}, {"iso_3166_1": "SE", "name": "Sweden"}, {"iso_3166_1": "AT", "name": "Austria"}], "release_date": "2007-12-25", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 91, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "da", "name": "Dansk"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "4.9", "vote_count": "5"}
