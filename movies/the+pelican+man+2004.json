He befriends Emil and Elsa, two children who--unlike adults--see that their new neighbor \"Mr Berd\" is not human but a big bird wearing a suit. The Pelican Man lands a job at the opera and falls in love with a pretty ballerina, looking so much like a bird herself. Troubles start when adults too find out about \"Mr Berd's\" ornithological origin.", "popularity": "0.120108", "poster_path": "/iE9hP3SzZsYzDf37BRQDHDrxwTJ.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2004-12-16", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fi", "name": "suomi"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.5", "vote_count": "2"}
