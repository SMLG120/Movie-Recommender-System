The challenges begin when Jonathan's nine\u2013year\u2013old daughter bounds into the bedroom very early the next morning. However, the stakes heighten when Jonathan discovers that David is his \"new client\" at the marketing firm where he is employed. Fraternizing with clients on the opposite side of the conference table is strictly prohibited by the firm, and Jonathan quickly nips things in the bud. As time progresses, love conquers all obstacles. Working against them are their different races, different countries of origin and homophobia.
