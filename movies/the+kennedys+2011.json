This is history through personality - the tangled relationships through which paint a picture of one of the most turbulent periods of the modern age. Viewers will be upstairs at the White House, not in the Cabinet Room. Through iconic events in history - the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the civil rights struggle, the mob connection - viewers will learn about the lesser known, yet critical personal stories.", "popularity": "0.789609", "poster_path": "/lA2bHgZ76ORcc6ilfT6ax6rJBg1.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Asylum Entertainment", "id": 4382}, {"name": "Muse Entertainment Enterprises", "id": 6438}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2011-04-03", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 0, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.0", "vote_count": "12"}
