Seventeen and pregnant, Felicia travels to England in search of her lover and is found instead by Joseph Ambrose Hilditch, a helpful catering manager whose kindness masks a serial killer. Hilditch has murdered several young women, but he has no conscious awareness of the crimes; like Felicia, he doesn't see his true self. Felicia's Journey is a story of innocence lost and regained: Felicia awakens to the world's dangers and duplicities; and Hilditch, who grew up lonely and unloved, comes to realize what was taken from him, and what he himself has taken.", "popularity": "1.850056", "poster_path": "/itqEwiINuYvaqvFKw5YWitnqAUc.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Alliance Atlantis Communications", "id": 803}, {"name": "Icon Entertainment International", "id": 4564}, {"name": "Marquis Films Ltd", "id": 24724}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "1999-11-24", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 116, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "gd", "name": ""}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.3", "vote_count": "24"}
