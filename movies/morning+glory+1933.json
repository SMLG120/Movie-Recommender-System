Her looks, more than her talent, attract the interest of a paternal actor, a philandering producer, and an earnest playwright. Is she destined for stardom or the \"casting couch\"? Will she fade after the brief blooming of a \"morning glory\"?  This was Katharine Hepburn's third film, and resulted in her first Academy Award for Best Actress. The film is based on a play and was remade in 1958 as \"Stage Struck\", with Susan Strasberg, Christopher Plummer and Henry Fonda in the three lead roles.", "popularity": "1.376116", "poster_path": "/wLcqCwK36mrOfInUInk0imT9CES.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "RKO Radio Pictures", "id": 6}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1933-08-18", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 74, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.7", "vote_count": "10"}
