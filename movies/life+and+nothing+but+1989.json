Major Dellaplane tirelessly matches the dead and the wounded with families' descriptions. Honor and ethics drive him; he hates the idea of \"the unknown soldier.\" Into his sector, looking for her husband, comes a haughty, politically connected Parisian, Madame Ir\u00e8ne de Courtil. Brusquely, Dellaplane offers her 1/350,000th of his time, but as their paths cross and she sees his courage and resolve, feelings change. After he finds a surprising connection between her missing husband and a local teacher, Ir\u00e8ne makes Dellaplane an offer. This man of action hesitates: has he missed his only chance?", "popularity": "0.006668", "poster_path": "/qoKzFkzOfWw5dOYfLlGIi4sxb5K.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Hachette Premi\u00e8re", "id": 582}, {"name": "Films A2", "id": 875}, {"name": "Little Bear", "id": 16772}, {"name": "Centre National de la Cin\u00e9matographie (CNC)", "id": 18367}, {"name": "Sofinergie 1", "id": 25513}, {"name": "AB Films", "id": 29654}, {"name": "Investimage", "id": 29655}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1989-09-06", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 135, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.4", "vote_count": "7"}
