While struggling to find some ideas-and annoying his mother (offscreen) with his loud music- a song plays on his boom box, titled Mesozoic Mind, and the song provides him with an inspiration for his report: DINOSAURS!  Philip then goes to sleep and has a dream where he discovers that the search for the truth about these magnificent animals and their astonishing 160-million-year success on earth is probably the most fascinating speculation there is. Phillip then finishes his report and presents it to the class. The class report is then covered through the 1980 claymation short Dinosaur by Will Vinton Productions.", "popularity": "0.004948", "poster_path": "/yrho3PbjV6MqxsCpLSWrwwut4q6.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1987-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 30, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "10.0", "vote_count": "1"}
