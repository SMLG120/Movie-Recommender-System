He\u2019s a typical macho. During the day he works his ass off and at night he gets drunk to blow off steam. As a child Remington mercilessly harassed his homosexual neighbor until the man put a curse on him. One day Remington would turn gay. And it seems like the curse is slowly but surely working its magic. Remington is being forced out of a closet he never thought he\u2019d be in. First his body language turns pink, then the way he talks and finally his sexual preference. Poor Remington finds himself entangled in a confusing threesome with his best friend and girlfriend. In the meantime his mother, a police officer, tries to find the perpetrator of a series of murders in the city\u2019s gay and transsexual community. And the victims do not intend to remain under ground. They\u2019re coming out of their coffins, Gloria Gaynor style !", "popularity": "0.673247", "poster_path": "/4C0Y9ZSYxWk91T1GxrGqP6jaGaG.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Reality Entertainment", "id": 58596}, {"name": "Post Manila", "id": 58597}, {"name": "Origin8 Media", "id": 59279}, {"name": "SQ Film Laboratories", "id": 59280}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "PH", "name": "Philippines"}], "release_date": "2011-08-31", "revenue": "721651", "runtime": 96, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.3", "vote_count": "5"}
