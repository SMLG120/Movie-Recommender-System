They meet after several years and he agrees to her suggestion that they star in a stage revival on Broadway of Noel Coward's comedy 'Private Lives', although Elizabeth Taylor has never before performed on stage. Burton soon regrets his agreement, however, when her pill-popping and lack of discipline causes problems already during the rehearsals. The play opens to a critical trashing, but is popular with audiences because they just want to see Taylor.  After a two month troubled run, the curtain comes down and Taylor tells Burton she has always loved him and still does.  A year later he is dead.", "popularity": "8.259261", "poster_path": "/jEjCPXsYjUjJiyVg3ShFEJLsgi8.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "BBC", "id": 5996}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2013-07-22", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 83, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.2", "vote_count": "14"}
