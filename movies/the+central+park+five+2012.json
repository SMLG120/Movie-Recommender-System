They spent between 6 and 13 years in prison before a serial rapist confessed that he alone had committed the crime, leading to their convictions being overturned. Set against a backdrop of a decaying city beset by violence and racial tension, this is the story of that horrific crime, the rush to judgment by the police, a media clamoring for sensational stories and an outraged public, and the five lives upended by this miscarriage of justice.", "popularity": "2.24163", "poster_path": "/8vxCgBGejodjZrC9noJM9KA8KUK.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Florentine Films", "id": 10722}, {"name": "WETA", "id": 10725}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2012-05-24", "revenue": "273747", "runtime": 119, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.8", "vote_count": "33"}
