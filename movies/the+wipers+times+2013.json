Full of gallows humour, The Wipers Times was poignant, subversive and very funny. Produced literally under enemy fire and defying both authority and gas attacks, the magazine proved a huge success with the troops on the western front. It was, above all, a tribute to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming adversity. In his spare time, Roberts also managed to win the Military Cross for gallantry.", "popularity": "5.207055", "poster_path": "/4eoayYCM6A14z0XkscKn80kxxD1.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)", "id": 3324}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2013-09-11", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.3", "vote_count": "6"}
