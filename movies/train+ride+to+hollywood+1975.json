The rest that follows is his dream. The four band members become conductors on a train filled with characters and (impersonated) actors from the 1930s, such as W.C. Fields, Dracula, and Scarlett O'Hara. Various songs are featured. The singing conductors are obliged to solve a mystery; Marlon Brando is murdering Nelson Eddy, Jeanette McDonald and others by suffocating them in his armpits. A wacky funeral, a fight with a gorilla, and the threat of being turned into a wax museum figure are all part of Harry's dream.", "popularity": "0.004393", "poster_path": "/5MM04G8JJtCNfNAqFNZfKeqYsW1.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Billy Jack Enterprises", "id": 36359}, {"name": "Crystal Jukebox Film Corp.", "id": 36360}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1975-10-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 89, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "0.0", "vote_count": "0"}
