They meet mainly at a bar owned by their former colleague Rico. Santa is the most superficially confident and the unofficial leader of the group. A court case hangs over him relating to a shipyard lamp he smashed during protest against the closure. Jos\u00e9 is bitter that his wife, Ana, is employed when he is not. The gap between them is widening and he is fearful that she will leave him for a co-worker. Despite arthritic legs, Ana endures night shifts at a fish factory and thinks her looks are now lost. Not everyone seems to agree including her boss. Lino, an aging family man doggedly pursuing positions beyond his qualifications. The oldest member of the group, Amador, has degenerated into alcoholism after being abandoned by his wife; maintaining an increasingly transparent pretense that his wife will soon return from holiday.", "popularity": "2.061389", "poster_path": "/qOn2xBS9ZsFJbF4Gsg1awXHTKhc.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "V\u00eda Digital", "id": 357}, {"name": "Eurimages", "id": 850}, {"name": "Continental Producciones", "id": 6279}, {"name": "Instituto de la Cinematograf\u00eda y de las Artes Audiovisuales (ICAA)", "id": 9974}, {"name": "Televisi\u00f3n de Galicia (TVG) S.A.", "id": 10050}, {"name": "Antena 3 Televisi\u00f3n", "id": 11737}, {"name": "Sogepaq", "id": 11955}, {"name": "El\u00edas Querejeta Producciones Cinematogr\u00e1ficas S.L.", "id": 12009}, {"name": "Mediapro", "id": 12010}, {"name": "Quo Vadis Cin\u00e9ma", "id": 12011}, {"name": "Eyescreen S.r.l.", "id": 12012}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "ES", "name": "Spain"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}], "release_date": "2002-09-27", "revenue": "146402", "runtime": 113, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}, {"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.0", "vote_count": "37"}
