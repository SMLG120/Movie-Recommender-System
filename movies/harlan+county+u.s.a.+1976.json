Eastovers refusal to sign a contract (when the miners joined with the United Mine Workers of America) led to the strike, which lasted more than a year and included violent battles between gun-toting company thugs/scabs and the picketing miners and their supportive women-folk. Director Barbara Kopple puts the strike into perspective by giving us some background on the historical plight of the miners and some history of the UMWA.", "popularity": "1.595006", "poster_path": "/sUHL2JkMExah3FQAjcbd64sCHQ1.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Cabin Creek Films", "id": 7942}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1976-10-15", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 103, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.7", "vote_count": "19"}
