The two \u2018parents\u2019 of the family are George and Bertha, who have two teenage children \u2013 or rather, they raise two former humans who they turned into vampires. Son Samson is a bit of a jack the lad: enjoying the sexual freedom of vampire life, with all the vigour of an irresponsible young adult regardless of consequences (even incest is not frowned upon in their world, where the word \u2018wife\u2019 is often synonymous with \u2018mother\u2019 or \u2018sister\u2019).
