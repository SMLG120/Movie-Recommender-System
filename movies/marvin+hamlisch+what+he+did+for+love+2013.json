Seemingly destined for greatness, Hamlisch was accepted into New York\u2019s Juilliard School as a 6-year-old musical prodigy and rapidly developed into a phenomenon. With instantly classic hits \u2018The Way We Were\u2019 and \u2018Nobody Does It Better\u2019 and scores for Hollywood films such as The Swimmer, The Sting and Sophie\u2019s Choice and the Broadway juggernaut A Chorus Line; Hamlisch became the go-to composer for film and Broadway producers and a prominent presence on the international Concert Hall circuit. His streak was staggering, vast, unprecedented and glorious, by the age of 31 Hamlisch had won 4 Grammys, an Emmy, 3 Oscars, a Tony and a Pulitzer prize: success that burned so bright, it proved impossible to match.", "popularity": "0.371755", "poster_path": "/yJca3h32YP72I31bvqdXubYSuxV.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2013-10-12", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 82, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "10.0", "vote_count": "1"}
