A strange plague has ravished the island. Supposedly spread by cockroaches, the disease sends its victims into a psychosis where they act like the insects. Eventually, they die. The Hole takes place in a crumbling apartment building. Its two protagonists live right above and below each other. The woman is on the lower floor, and the pipes above her apartment are leaking fiercely, threatening to destroy her food supply, not to mention her sanity. She calls a plumber to go check it out, and he accidentally pokes a hole through the floor of the man's apartment. The two have never met before, and they come into contact through the hole.", "popularity": "0.578245", "poster_path": "/xr4yVgmYzds0PqMRaGfrLpDzsUF.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Haut et Court", "id": 726}, {"name": "Arc Light Films", "id": 7475}, {"name": "La Sept-Arte", "id": 11332}, {"name": "Central Motion Pictures", "id": 25345}, {"name": "China Television (CTV)", "id": 76897}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "TW", "name": "Taiwan"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1998-09-14", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 95, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "zh", "name": "\u666e\u901a\u8bdd"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.2", "vote_count": "16"}
