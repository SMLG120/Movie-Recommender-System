Forced to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair, Ben is deeply desperate, despite his humor and vivaciousness. When he meets Christian, his new assistant, Ben treats him like every other helper he\u2019s had. Things suddenly change when Christian meets Annika, \u201cthe cello player\u201d whom Ben has been observing from his window for years. The three become close friends, putting Annika in the middle of an emotional, and somehow dangerous, m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois. While conquering Annika is nothing very serious for career-focused Christian, Ben\u2019s love for Annika reminds him of his past and forces him to face his most remote fears. A character-driven story, Run If You Can owes much of its power to the actors\u2019 performances, especially Robert Gwisdek\u2019s outstanding interpretation of Ben.", "popularity": "0.165787", "poster_path": "/4WfipZpehd0OhpEGap13R8RpyG8.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR)", "id": 7025}, {"name": "W\u00fcste Film Ost", "id": 11673}, {"name": "S\u00fcdwestrundfunk (SWR)", "id": 16110}, {"name": "arte Geie", "id": 16661}, {"name": "W\u00fcste Film West GmbH", "id": 23153}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}], "release_date": "2010-07-28", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 112, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.7", "vote_count": "3"}
