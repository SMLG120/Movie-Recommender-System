This work employs the subtle and sometimes bold use of color to emphasize its themes, but mainly is presented in black-and-white, or tinted in monochrome. No spoken dialogue can be heard, and the story of a sinister but intriguing immigrant who preys upon young English women unfolds through dance, pantomime and subtitles.", "popularity": "0.810769", "poster_path": "/qFL57Kl4ryskdgR1VeXxozcLqM5.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)", "id": 12113}, {"name": "Dracula Productions Inc.", "id": 94410}, {"name": "Vonnie Von Helmolt Film", "id": 94411}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}], "release_date": "2002-02-28", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 75, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.9", "vote_count": "8"}
