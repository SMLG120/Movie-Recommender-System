Distracted by the latest break-up, she bumps into a car and a man steps out of it - who turns out to be her new boss, Robin Heiden. Heiden has very clear ideas about a relationship and love: both are a game of power and Min-Joon seeks advice from him, as she doesn't want to get dumped again. However, when she starts to treat men like Heiden treats women, she realizes that she prefers her older behaviour, even if that means that she gets dumped again; she doesn't see love as a game of power and never will. Heiden, who has to deal with his own heartbreak, as he loved a woman so much that she had to shoot him to get the message across that she wasn't interested in him, starts to soften at Min-joon's attitude towards life. He eventually falls in love with her and both get into a real relationship and a happy ending of their own.", "popularity": "0.732452", "poster_path": "/ngB4FjRZdrRE5A2QgR19m1CuMnY.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "KR", "name": "South Korea"}], "release_date": "2006-12-07", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 107, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ko", "name": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4/\uc870\uc120\ub9d0"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.3", "vote_count": "19"}
