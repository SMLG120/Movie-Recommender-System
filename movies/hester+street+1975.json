When his wife (Carol Kane) finally arrives in the New World, however, she has a lot of assimilating to do. This causes the tension which drives the movie along, though it maintains a fairly light atmosphere most of the time.", "popularity": "0.528717", "poster_path": "/52Y0yBsv1H3Pts3DOHeBDTOnJ0.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Midwest Films", "id": 31702}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1975-10-19", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "yi", "name": ""}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.6", "vote_count": "7"}
