A year later their son, nicknamed Tietou (Iron Head), is born. The Party is everywhere: Mao's photograph, loud-speaker announcements, visits from the neighborhood committee. Shaolong dies in a reform camp; a close family friend, who protects Shujuan and her son partly out of guilt for lying to authorities about Shaolong, succumbs to malnutrition; a confrontation with the Red Guard leads to injury, imprisonment and death. Shujuan's love for Tietou sustains her, and the child's blue kite embodies hope: \"I can make another for you,\" says Tietou's dad; by the end, Tietou promises this to a small child.", "popularity": "2.16468", "poster_path": "/eMXMjAsKVJ54nTO00ofTuleuqfb.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Beijing Film Studio", "id": 708}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CN", "name": "China"}, {"iso_3166_1": "HK", "name": "Hong Kong"}], "release_date": "1994-02-02", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 140, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "zh", "name": "\u666e\u901a\u8bdd"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.4", "vote_count": "11"}
