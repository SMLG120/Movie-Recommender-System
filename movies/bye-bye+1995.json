Isma\u00e9l becomes friends with Jacky, a white man whose father and brother hate immigrants. Mouloud hangs out with cousin Rhida who breaks Islamic rules and deals hash. Isma\u00e9l decides Mouloud must return to Tunisia, but the boy runs off, becoming an acolyte to Rhida's supplier. Isma\u00e9l and Jacky's Arab girlfriend start an affair, friends betray friends, and the racism gets ugly.
