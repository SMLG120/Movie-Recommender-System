Discovering talented filmmakers and developing films that fit his conception of the cinema, free and true to life, is precisely his reason for living. Gregoire devotes almost all of his time and energy to his work. Although he spends weekends with his family at their house in the country, even these precious moments are regularly interrupted by demanding directors and concerned investors. While Gregoires very presence commands admiration, and his exceptional charisma lead many to believe he is invincible, the future of his prestigious production company, Moon Films, is in doubt; too many productions, too many risks, too many debts. Storm clouds are gathering, and Gregoires realisation that he may have made one gamble too many will trigger a series of events that will change the lives of his family forever.", "popularity": "1.389502", "poster_path": "/yfS1DZ3amYdhbNSsObVOKGrJQDr.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Lighthouse Pictures", "id": 6345}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "2009-12-16", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 110, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.8", "vote_count": "19"}
