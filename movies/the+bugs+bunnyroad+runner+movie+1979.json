These animations are interspersed by Bugs Bunny reminiscing on past events and providing links between the individual animations which are otherwise unconnected. This 1979 feature-length compilation includes several of his best cartoons. Among the 11 shorts shown in their entirety are the classics \"Robin Hood Daffy,\" \"What's Opera, Doc?,\" \"Bully for Bugs,\" and \"Duck Amuck\". The Bugs Bunny Road Runner Movie provides a showcase not only for Jones's razor-sharp timing, but for the work of his exceptional crew, which included designer Maurice Noble, writer Mike Maltese, composers Carl Stalling and Milt Franklyn, and voice actor Mel Blanc.", "popularity": "2.684017", "poster_path": "/pueP9CdOOFGqyogkSJfN09PBeHv.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Warner Bros.", "id": 6194}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1979-09-30", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 98, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.7", "vote_count": "29"}
