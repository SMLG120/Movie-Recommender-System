Life goes on without major mishaps in a large house surrounded by a beautiful garden. It is a wonderful world, a great bubble of comfort, where different personal spheres coexist: the mother, along with her three children and the Aymara inhabitants of the house. The drama surfaces slowly, without narrative ploys, observing day-to-day activities until internal and external forces make the bubble burst. The film relates the story of the final days of an upper-class family, at a time when the country is undergoing social changes.", "popularity": "0.22964", "poster_path": "/qGknr9SF3p0aZtEM5BhGiSUMqIU.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "BO", "name": "Bolivia"}], "release_date": "2009-08-20", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 109, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ay", "name": ""}, {"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.6", "vote_count": "4"}
