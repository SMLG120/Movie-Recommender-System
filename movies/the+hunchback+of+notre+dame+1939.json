Frollo gazes on the gypsy girl, Esmeralda, in the church during Fool's Day and sends Quasimodo to catch her. Quasimodo, with the girl, is captured by Phoebus, Captain of the Guards, who frees the girl. The courts sentence Quasimodo to be flogged, and the only one who will give him water while he is tied in the square is Esmeralda. Later, at a party of nobles, Esmeralda again meets both Frollo, who is bewitched by her, and Phoebus. When Phoebus is stabbed to death, Esmeralda is accused of the murder, convicted by the court and sentenced to hang. Clopin, King of the Beggars; Gringoire, Esmeralda's husband; and Quasimodo, the bellringer, all try different ways to save her from the gallows.", "popularity": "4.42224", "poster_path": "/3ZIMmQ4KMKKBT1NSM5FSmWGOLWH.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "RKO Radio Pictures", "id": 6}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1939-12-29", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 116, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.6", "vote_count": "34"}
