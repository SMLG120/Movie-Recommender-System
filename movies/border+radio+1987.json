A low-key, semi-improvised postpunk diary that took four years to complete, Border Radio features legendary rocker Chris D., of the Flesh Eaters, as a singer/songwriter who has stolen loot from a club and gone missing, leaving his wife (Luanna Anders), a no-nonsense rock journalist, to track him down with the help of his friends (John Doe of the band X; Chris Shearer). With its sprawling Southern Californian and Mexican landscapes, captured in evocative 16mm black and white, Border Radio is a singular, DIY memento of the indie film explosion in America.", "popularity": "0.308762", "poster_path": "/eeQPYT3lDoW07LvAnwzBVU7EYJm.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Coyote Productions", "id": 11024}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1987-11-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 83, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "4.9", "vote_count": "4"}
