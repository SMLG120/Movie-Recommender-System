Pascale always acted as if she was the provider and head of the household, even now the inseparable brothers are twenty. But she started a secret affair with Flemish neighbor, cook Jan, whose ambition is to start a restaurant and B&amp;B with her. As the boys learn she wants to cancel her job and sell the house for the project, college-man Thierry, who has a steady girl Anne, naturally refuses to let her spend dad's money meant for them. Gentler Fran\u00e7ois, content to remain a handyman, would consider letting her and maybe working in the 'family business'. This causes trouble, even after Pascale moves out to Gerda's indefinitely, leading to tragedy.", "popularity": "1.733661", "poster_path": "/2pTUkFGcrS21xeQTfmY60GaJkU4.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "MACT Productions", "id": 393}, {"name": "Canal+", "id": 5358}, {"name": "Cin\u00e9Cin\u00e9ma", "id": 6301}, {"name": "Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Belge Francophone (RTBF)", "id": 7466}, {"name": "Tarantula", "id": 8471}, {"name": "Wallimage", "id": 12352}, {"name": "Sofica Sog\u00e9cin\u00e9ma 2", "id": 26233}, {"name": "R\u00e9gion Wallonne", "id": 28507}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "BE", "name": "Belgium"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "LU", "name": "Luxembourg"}], "release_date": "2006-09-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 95, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.4", "vote_count": "9"}
