Turing's achievements went unrecognised during his lifetime. Instead he ended up being treated as a common criminal, for being homosexual at a time when homosexual acts were a crime.  In 1952, he was convicted of 'gross indecency' with another man and was forced to undergo so-called 'organo-therapy' - chemical castration.  Two years later, he killed himself with cyanide, aged just 41. Alan Turing was driven to a terrible despair and early death by the nation he'd done so much to save.", "popularity": "3.605686", "poster_path": "/6hzKdnr5WRUzH4AsbCPmEWQ3Ph3.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Channel 4", "id": 14966}, {"name": "Story Center Films", "id": 39084}, {"name": "Furnace", "id": 39085}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2011-11-21", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 62, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.4", "vote_count": "7"}
