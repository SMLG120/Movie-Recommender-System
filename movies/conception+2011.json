From a couple fighting the odds of fertility to young teenagers losing their virginity, the film follows nine very different couples on the night they conceive, showing that sex can sometimes be more neurotic than erotic. The hilarious ensemble cast includes Emmy-winner Julie Bowen and Sarah Hyland (\u201cModern Family\u201d), Connie Britton (\u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d), David Arquette (Never Been Kissed), Jason Mantzoukas (\u201cThe League\u201d), and Alan Tudyk (Dodgeball).", "popularity": "0.594675", "poster_path": "/euPIlYhRzJkap13cLDMvfVHDBVA.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2011-01-01", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 77, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "hu", "name": "Magyar"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "4.4", "vote_count": "9"}
