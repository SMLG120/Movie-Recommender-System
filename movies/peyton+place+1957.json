Set during WWII, the film concentrates on several denizens of the outwardly respectable New England community of Peyton Place.  Top-billed Lana Turner plays shopkeeper Constance McKenzie, who tries to make up for a past indiscretion -- which resulted in her illegitimate daughter Allison (Diane Varsi) -- by adopting a chaste, prudish attitude towards all things sexual.  In spite of herself, Constance can't help but be attracted to handsome new teacher Michael Rossi (Lee Philips).  Meanwhile, the restless Allison, who'd like to be as footloose and fancy-free as the town's \"fast girl\" Betty Anderson (Terry Moore), falls sincerely in love with mixed-up mama's boy Norman Page (Russ Tamblyn).", "popularity": "1.990531", "poster_path": "/hD4vMxAdAL238tpC4oYJNAYRa33.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation", "id": 306}, {"name": "Jerry Wald Productions", "id": 10917}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1957-12-13", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 151, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.3", "vote_count": "16"}
