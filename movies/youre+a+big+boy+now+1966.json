Her name is Barbara Darling, an inscrutable go-go dancer. More than a few obstacles keep Bernard from his dream world. There's his doting mother, who mails him locks of her hair and weeps at the thought of her baby as a man; there's a malicious rooster, trained to attack pretty girls, patrolling the halls of his New York City rooming house; and most of all, there's Barbara herself. She turns out to be a man hater, emotionally scarred by the lecherous wooden-legged hypnotherapist who \"counseled\" her in high school. All in all, Bernard finds himself in an improbable universe with a calculated clumsiness designed to evoke his confusing coming-of-age.", "popularity": "2.134702", "poster_path": "/whBI9xs5HMZOH7keLz3SD0skefw.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Seven Arts Productions", "id": 516}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1966-09-09", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 97, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.9", "vote_count": "13"}
