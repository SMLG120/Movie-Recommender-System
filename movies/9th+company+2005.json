After several one-by-one dalliances with the local whore, Snow White, and a cautionary lecture on the history, geography and culture of Afghanistan (which most of the men sleep through), the trainees head off to battle - first to the Bagram air base, then to the Afghani province of Khost to secure supply lines. But nothing can begin to prepare them for the brutal devastation into which they are plunged, or the relentless tide of slaughter that scatters thousands of Soviet victims in its wake.", "popularity": "9.586723", "poster_path": "/8LqqdxD0Ol7PslyRyP6sCqoIxqm.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Finnish Film Foundation", "id": 2396}, {"name": "Matila R\u00f6hr Productions (MRP)", "id": 5240}, {"name": "Yleisradio (YLE)", "id": 5975}, {"name": "Art Pictures Group", "id": 16688}, {"name": "Slovo", "id": 17962}, {"name": "Channel 1+1", "id": 22690}, {"name": "Telekanal STS", "id": 22691}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "RU", "name": "Russia"}, {"iso_3166_1": "UA", "name": "Ukraine"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FI", "name": "Finland"}], "release_date": "2005-09-19", "revenue": "24000000", "runtime": 139, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ru", "name": "P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.8", "vote_count": "65"}
