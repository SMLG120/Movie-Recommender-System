Catapulting us into the action spread across 2011 and 2012, the film provides a kaleidoscopic, visceral experience of the struggle. Cairo\u2019s Tahrir Square is the heart and soul of the film, which follows several young activists. Armed with values, determination, music, humor, an abundance of social media, and sheer obstinacy, they know that the thorny path to democracy only began with Hosni Mubarek\u2019s fall. The life-and-death struggle between the people and the power of the state is still playing out.", "popularity": "4.689168", "poster_path": "/is5AiT3jjLMh8uxSpDF856NFVkp.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Roast Beef Productions", "id": 7266}, {"name": "Worldview Entertainment", "id": 9015}, {"name": "Noujaim Films", "id": 27197}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}, {"iso_3166_1": "EG", "name": "Egypt"}], "release_date": "2013-06-07", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 88, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ar", "name": "\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.8", "vote_count": "56"}
