As he developed the script, his thought was to place these marginal characters, who are subject to societal prejudices in an environment where there is already discrimination, would add dramatic effect. Supported by funding from German sources, Ataman set his story in Berlin, inside the community of \"guest workers\" where Turkish transvestites are shunned not only by Germans, but by their own kind as well. The result is a strong film with moments of tenderness, emotion and laughter juxtaposed with the harsh realities of life for those who dare to be different. 16 year old Murat (Baki Davrak) is a Turk who is curious about gay life and eventually submerges himself in the gay hustler and transvestite subculture.", "popularity": "0.835746", "poster_path": "/5l0o50Ga9OJgnoxQWPtEeL1wS4n.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Zero Film GmbH", "id": 2511}, {"name": "Catpics Co Productions AG", "id": 5032}, {"name": "Good Machine", "id": 10565}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}], "release_date": "1999-02-12", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 91, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "tr", "name": "T\u00fcrk\u00e7e"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.8", "vote_count": "7"}
