They are forced to form a battery: a catcher and a pitcher who work together to outwit the batter, the one who hits the ball. And the batter in this case just happens to be a zombie. Tough Ben and gentle Mickey frequently disagree on the best way to go about the situation. Then they suddenly hear a human voice through their walkie-talkies. Is salvation nearby, like Mickey thinks, or is Ben\u2019s suspicion justified?", "popularity": "3.530559", "poster_path": "/4SUoy9s4f2RZ09IiaDLi1EHNbDV.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "O.
