For generations, they have been reincarnated as mere mortals, and they won't be allowed back to heaven until they've learned to coexist in harmony. Then in today's Hong Kong, a mortuary beautician and her has-been singer dad are chased for a huge sum of money they don't owe. Turns out her materialistic stepmom has taken a tycoon's advance payment on the false promise of organizing a concert that she can't deliver. The family is therefore forced to go on the run, and along the way they meet an assortment of quirky people, including a mute baker, a kung fu cab driver, an aspiring musician and her crafty sidekick. Through a series of comic misadventures, the seven of them come to realize that they used to be gods and have a mission in this life, but...who is the eighth god that has yet to rejoin them?", "popularity": "0.170936", "poster_path": "/tUnNXUI4PZ6DGhsM777H90CONZW.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "HK", "name": "Hong Kong"}], "release_date": "2011-11-24", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 100, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "cn", "name": "\u5e7f\u5dde\u8bdd / \u5ee3\u5dde\u8a71"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.0", "vote_count": "1"}
