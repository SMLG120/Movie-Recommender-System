Momo is the oldest and her favorite, an Algerian lad whom she raises as a Muslim. He asks about his parents; she answers evasively. As she ages and takes fewer children, Momo must do more for her; as money is tight, he tries to earn pennies on the street with a puppet. He's a beautiful man-child, and Madame Rosa makes him promise never to sell himself or become a pimp. A film editor, Nadine, befriends him, and his father appears as well. Madame Rosa reaches her last days in fear of hospitals, and Momo must act.", "popularity": "0.180579", "poster_path": "/mskFSRNmH5FwU2XoiHmwRlzqJtu.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1977-11-02", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 105, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.3", "vote_count": "3"}
