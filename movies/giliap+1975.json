But central for the plot are three persons: a male waiter who is never named (here called W), the female waiter Anna, and \"the count\", a self-invented nickname by a man cleaning plates. The count is skilled in making others do what he wants. Half a dozen of the personnel assist in a poorly planned and failed attempt to liberate a man whom the police move from one arrest to another. The event involves stealing a motorcycle and threatening policemen with a gun. Anna strongly tries to make contact with W. Finally it turns out that she need his help to break her sexual relation to the count, a relation that from her part is not motivated by positive feelings. W rejects her attempts. And then Anna has suddenly gone. She has got a pleasant job in another town. And then W's feelings awaken.", "popularity": "0.004425", "poster_path": "/g5SrQgmuezUtRlKnNi4ZKaTHjfb.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1975-11-16", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 140, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "sv", "name": "svenska"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.9", "vote_count": "7"}
