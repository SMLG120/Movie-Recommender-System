While escaping war-torn China, a group of Europeans crash in the Himalayas, where they are rescued and taken to the mysterious Valley of the Blue Moon, Shangri-La. Hidden from the rest of the world, Shangri-La is a haven of peace and tranquility for world-weary diplomat Richard Conway. His ambitious brother, George, sees it as a prison from which he must escape, even if it means risking his life and bringing destruction to the ancient culture of Shangri-La.", "popularity": "0.907629", "poster_path": "/oHBfysQXM8wfcWWfisojn2Ae0BU.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Columbia Pictures Corporation", "id": 441}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1973-03-17", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 143, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "4.6", "vote_count": "7"}
