Kira insults Asano publicly for the slight, prompting the outraged Asano to draw his sward against the older man within the castle, a capital offense.  Asano is then forced to commit seppuku and his fief is confiscated, his retainers dispersed.  Twenty-one months later, after making elaborate plans, forty-seven of Asano\u2019s loyal retainers attack Kira\u2019s mansion on a snowy night and take their revenge.  Though their vendetta was criminal, the forty-seven attract the sympathies of the public and government alike and are allowed the privilege of dying honourably at their own hands.", "popularity": "0.668944", "poster_path": "/jcgkwZzgb0zy0cSnywrAdWKCROW.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Daiei Studios", "id": 881}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "JP", "name": "Japan"}], "release_date": "1958-03-31", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 166, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.0", "vote_count": "1"}
