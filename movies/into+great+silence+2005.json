It is an intimate portrayal of the everyday lives of Carthusian monks of the Grande Chartreuse, high in the French Alps (Chartreuse Mountains). The idea for the film was proposed to the monks in 1984, but the Carthusians said they wanted time to think about it. The Carthusians finally contacted Gr\u00f6ning 16 years later to say they were now willing to permit Gr\u00f6ning to shoot the movie, if he was still interested.", "popularity": "0.460854", "poster_path": "/5Ih9VWrwwT4RiarFQxGJccIstYr.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CH", "name": "Switzerland"}, {"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "2005-09-04", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 162, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "la", "name": "Latin"}, {"iso_639_1": "pl", "name": "Polski"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "8.4", "vote_count": "5"}
