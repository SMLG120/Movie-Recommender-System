His most perfidious film was the treacherous anti-Semitic propaganda film Jud S\u00fc\u00df - required viewing for all SS members. An unrepentant and blindly obsessive craftsman, no figure - save for Leni Riefenstahl - is as closely associated with the cinema of the Holocaust years. (Harlan's epic Kolberg was the basis for Inglourious Basterds's pivotal film-within-a-film Stolz Der Nation.) This documentary is an eye-opening examination of World War II film history as well as the story of a German family from the Third Reich to the present; one that is marked by reckoning, denial and liberation.", "popularity": "0.145908", "poster_path": "/5pwc8oZHU2crTM9791Gkiu2MftH.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR)", "id": 7201}, {"name": "Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung", "id": 18492}, {"name": "Blueprint Film", "id": 47325}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}], "release_date": "2009-04-23", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 100, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "it", "name": "Italiano"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "5.0", "vote_count": "4"}
