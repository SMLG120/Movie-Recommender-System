Based on the children's song The Cat Came Back, it concerns the increasingly desperate and lonely man named Mr. Johnson, an old man who attempts to rid himself of a small, yet extremely destructive, yellow cat that will not leave his home. The attempts to get rid of the cat become more comical, and the cat becomes increasingly destructive, until Mr. Johnson resorts to an explosive solution. The result is a twist ending playing on the end of the children's song, with the cat's nine lives bedeviling Mr. Johnson for eternity.\"", "popularity": "0.006668", "poster_path": "/svWiNWUX39ylBjDaexrk4LxcYUY.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "National Film Board of Canada", "id": 10473}, {"name": "National Film Board of Canada (NFB)", "id": 17027}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}], "release_date": "1988-06-22", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 7, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.4", "vote_count": "14"}
