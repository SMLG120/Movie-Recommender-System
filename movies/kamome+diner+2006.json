On a quiet street in Helsinki, Sachie has opened a diner featuring rice balls. For a month she has no customers. Then, in short order, she has her first customer, meets Midori, a gangly Japanese tourist, and invites her to stay with her, and meets Masako, a formal and ethereal middle-aged woman whose luggage has gone missing. The three women work in the diner, interact, and serve customers. A somewhat brusque man teaches Sachie to make delicious coffee, then he returns under other circumstances. Three neighborhood women inspect the empty diner every day; will anything bring them inside? The number of customers gradually increases, but the diner seems to attract only those with problems. Conversation with Sachie and the tasty food seem to resolve people's woes. We learn why Sachie serves rice balls; but why Finland?", "popularity": "0.944834", "poster_path": "/6OyLUl1TxyCvmd4TZyXi4piU6gl.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "JP", "name": "Japan"}], "release_date": "2006-06-11", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 102, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fi", "name": "suomi"}, {"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "7.1", "vote_count": "10"}
