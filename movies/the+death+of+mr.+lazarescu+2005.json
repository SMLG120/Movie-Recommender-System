When he starts feeling unusually ill, he first seeks painkillers from his neighbors. It soon becomes apparent that Lazarescu is indeed sick, and an ambulance arrives with a nurse (Luminita Gheorghiu) who has a few ideas about what could be the problem. However, a major traffic accident and poor organization leaves little room in Romanian hospitals for the fading Lazarescu.", "popularity": "3.360684", "poster_path": "/aWKZxHahcKq6LfJ8cSE96lAvJ0t.jpg", "production_companies": [{"name": "Mandragora", "id": 13407}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "RO", "name": "Romania"}], "release_date": "2005-05-17", "revenue": "0", "runtime": 150, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ro", "name": "Rom\u00e2n\u0103"}], "status": "Released", "vote_average": "6.8", "vote_count": "46"}
